Youâ€™ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. Itâ€™s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends. Build and Grow Your City The heart of the game is city building and management. When you''re just starting out, you''ll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. Once you''ve achieved a foothold in the world, it''s up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish. Level Up Your Settlers All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities. Usually, to assign someone a new job you''ll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he''ll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that''s both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area. Player Driven Legacy Through Modding We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. As a modder youâ€™ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where â€œthe gameâ€ is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster.	;;	2019-06-21	;;	170.33	;;	44	;;	5

Contra Anniversary Collection	;;	The Contra Anniversary Collection brings this classic Run and Gun franchise back to modern platforms and a new generation of gamers.	;;	About This Game  Shadow Tactics is a hardcore tactical stealth game set in Japan around the Edo period. Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact. The group is composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons. One of the leaders of this team is Hayato, an agile ninja, who clears the way through his enemies silently, with his sword and shuriken. Samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat more fiends at one time, but thus also forfeiting flexibility. Aiko is a master of camouflage when she distracts enemies disguised as a Geisha. And the street child Yuki places traps and decoys enemies towards their deadly fate. The mysterious marksman Takuma however, relies on his sniper rifle and takes care of the enemies from a distance. The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions.

It is designed to perform many of the things you can do while playing at a conventional gaming table and move it online. Shop DLC in the updated Steam Store You can browse by category more easily from the SmiteWorks Publish Page link below. BROWSE DLC . A Note about DLC for Fantasy Grounds Fantasy Grounds has a wealth of DLC available as add-ons. Each of these DLC add-ons expands Fantasy Grounds to support a brand new game system or to add new adventures and supplements from your favorite game publishers and artists. SmiteWorks has negotiated license deals with several dozen different RPG Game publishers and artists, both large and small, to bring you a very large variety of gaming options. Our agreements with these publishers and artists provide royalties for every purchase made through Steam and elsewhere, so that a purchase of DLC for Fantasy Grounds is the equivalent to or better for the publisher than walking into a game store or book store and buying a physical book from the publisher. Each and every purchase is directly helping fund and grow the RPG hobby industry. The share that SmiteWorks retains for this helps pay our content and programming developers and helps us add support for more and more games. In many cases, the content you can buy as DLC can be built directly by you within Fantasy Grounds if you already own the material in another form. The DLC provides a convenient option for time-strapped gamers who also wish to directly support the gaming industry. * This is not a stand-alone game. This game features no computer controlled AI and relies upon another user acting as a Gamemaster to control the story, action and enemies you face. Overview Fantasy Grounds is a hybrid application which allows you to play and create your own RPG games. It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation. Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players. Games may be played in a session as short as a few hours or continued with multiple sessions over a series of days, weeks, months or years. A GM will typically install the application and choose their game-system of choice, which we refer to as a Ruleset. Fantasy Grounds comes pre-loaded with Rulesets supporting compatible play for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2E, Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, Dungeons & Dragons 4E, Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (R). Additional Rulesets are available for free and for purchase from our Workshop. The 3.5E, 5E and PFRPG rulesets are good places to start for new GMs and for people new to Fantasy Grounds. These Rulesets come pre-loaded with some basic Library modules full of abilities, spells, monsters and items that have been marked as Open Gaming Content (OGC) by their respective copyright holders.  The 5E ruleset contains all the content from the D&D Basic Rules for D&D fifth edition. Additional rulesets, such as that for Call of Cthulhu or Savage Worlds are fully licensed versions and contain otherwise closed and proprietary content that we''ve licensed from those publishers. As of April 2015, Fantasy Grounds acquired an official license from Wizards of the Coast for D&D fifth edition. This means that the 5E ruleset supports basic understanding and gameplay for D&D fifth edition but you can also buy fully preloaded data packs and adventures that are licensed from Wizards of the Coast as DLC here on Steam. Players For players, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to connect to a game being hosted by a GM and control one or more characters within the game. You will be able to update and maintain your character sheet, much like you would in a face-to-face RPG game, but with some degree of automation and support for dragging and dropping abilities and items from the Library modules (for rulesets which support them.) Whenever a GM shares a map image, you will be able to move a token representing your character and initiate attack rolls against enemies visible on those maps when it is your turn. You will be interacting within the GM''s game session with other players and every action you take will be communicated to the GM and connected players along with any chat messages you enter into the chat window. At the conclusion of the GM''s game session, you will log out and your character sheet and progress will be saved to the GM''s session. When you meet back up and a pre-scheduled time with the GM for the next session, you will be able to continue where you left off.  Scheduling of future game sessions is handled outside of Fantasy Grounds via email communication, the Fantasy Grounds forums and Game Calendar, Steam discussions or through whatever source the GM defines.  SmiteWorks hopes to improve the match-making features at a later date. GameMasters For GameMasters, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to outline and prepare your future game sessions. You will be able to create story entries and link them together or to specific maps. You could, for instance, create a story entry which links to an image of a dungeon and then each room could in turn be linked to individual story entries -- each containing room descriptions, secret GM notes, a list of NPCs and monster encounters or links to more images and player hand-outs. Depending on your game master style and the availability of pre-entered monsters and enemies, you can also run without preparation. You can create and maintain multiple Campaigns, each with their own content and players. When you are ready to run your campaign, you will need to spend some time recruiting players and establishing your preferred frequency and length of play, methods of communication when you are not connected with Fantasy Grounds and whether or not you want to use a voice application such as Skype or Google Hangouts alongside Fantasy Grounds. Most GMs tend to use a combination of in-game text-based chat within Fantasy Grounds *and* a voice application to help facilitate quicker and more natural play. With this version of the product, you can: Run games as the Gamemaster (GM) Host games as a GM for other players and GMs who are connected as players Host a demo game for 1 player who is using only the FG Demo. The campaign won''t allow saving, but will give you the ability to demonstrate the functionality to prospective players. Join games as a player Create characters locally to take with you into a game session Create additional rulesets and modifications with custom XML and LUA Scripting Use hundreds of built-in top-down tokens for monsters, characters and animals 	;;	2016-03-27	;;	107.22	;;	22	;;	5

NecroDancer ULTIMATE PACK	;;	NecroDancer ULTIMATE PACK bundle	;;	About This Game  THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the rulerâ€™s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment â€“ the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: thereâ€™s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small â€“ like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction â€“ but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but donâ€™t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your societyâ€™s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunkâ€™s Endless Mode is the latest, longly awaited update requested by our community. Itâ€™s the biggest DLC to the game so far, offering new maps, game modes, mechanics, and it will allow you to dive into the Frostpunk experience deeper than ever before. 	;;	2019-06-05	;;	40.25	;;	93	;;	5

Playable factions, cultures and kings: Thrones of Britannia will include ten playable factions, from five cultures, with a summary below. The Anglo Saxons â€“ West Seaxe and Mierce When Roman rule in England concluded, new kingdoms of Germanic stock coalesced in the counties now known as Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, Essex, Sussex, East Anglia and Kent. The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons. West Seaxe Faction Leader: King Alfred As the domit Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe â€“ or Wessex in modern English â€“ provided the isleâ€™s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfredâ€™s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD. Mierce Faction Leader: Ceowulf From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce â€“ known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle. The Gaels â€“ Mide and Circenn Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland. With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba â€“ essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. Mide Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title. With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far awayâ€¦ the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy? Circenn Faction Leader: Ãed mac CinÃ¡eda Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circennâ€™s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist â€“ both within and without. Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stoneâ€™s recovery would be an adventure worth undertakingâ€¦ The Welsh â€“ Gwined and Strat Clut The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. Ironically, the term â€˜Welshâ€™ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, â€˜wealasâ€™, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. Gwined Faction Leader: King Anaraut The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of ''true Britons\', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves â€˜Englishâ€™. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. Strat Clut Faction Leader: Run Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run. The Great Viking Army â€“ Northymbre and East Engle In 865 AD, Ragnarâ€™s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfredâ€™s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered. Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle â€“ provided they kept Alfredâ€™s peace, of course. Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequenceâ€¦ Northymbre Faction Leader: Guthfrid When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York â€“ or Eoferwic, as was â€“ for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelleâ€™s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual. Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfredâ€™s peace. East Engle Faction Leader: Guthrum Forming the bulk of Britanniaâ€™s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Armyâ€™s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Ã†thelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw. Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight. The Viking Sea Kings â€“ Dyflin and Sudreyar After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfredâ€™s defeat of the Great Viking army. These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique. Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from Englandâ€™s upstart rulerâ€¦ Dyflin Faction Leader: Bardr Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britanniaâ€™s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. By 878 AD however, Imarâ€™s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of oneâ€™s warrior-bloodâ€¦ Sudreyar Faction Leader: Eirik To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy. Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area. Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers.	;;	2000-10-13	;;	114.80	;;	60	;;	4

AssettoCorsaUltimateEdition	;;	Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition bundle	;;	About This Game  Enter the world of Eco, a fully simulated ecosystem bustling with thousands of growing plants and animals living their lives. Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction.  Can you save the world without destroying it in the process? Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet. As your civilization grows, youâ€™ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world.  Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands. Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor.  Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system. Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws.  The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world. Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money.  Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote.   Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust. Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success. In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the gameâ€™s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment. To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources.  Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players.  Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one anotherâ€™s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the worldâ€™s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions.  While a meteor looms over head â€”  set to strike the planet in thirty days â€” a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment.  Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes.  To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection. Included Features Online Multiplayer - Collaborate online with a community of players. Local Singleplayer - Build your own world, with the option to invite friends. Dedicated Server Included - Host your own Eco worlds. Over 30 different craft tables, with hundreds of recipes. Hundreds of items, skills, craft tables, and building blocks. A simulated ecosystem with dozens of unique species. With limited carrying capacity, players must create vehicles and networks of roads to transport materials. Create your own backed or fiat currencies, using them as a means of exchange in the economy. Build stores where you can sell your excess items for a profit. Eat varied and nutritious food and build ever larger homes to increase your skills. Create contracts for jobs that you would like players with different skill-specialties to accomplish for you.  Take on contracts from other players that need the skills you possess. Design laws using programmable template system to protect your world or increase your profits, enforced by the game if ratified by the population. Run for election and make decisions that affect the globe. View and compile rich data from the simulation and use it to argue for group decisions. Claim land as your own property, and share access rights. Give and remove reputation from other players. Find a balance between progress and protection, between individual needs and those of the group, succeeding or failing together. 	;;	2004-07-02	;;	119.09	;;	97	;;	1

In every house you''ll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you''re not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you! A real, experienced thief can spot places where there''s most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the flashlight at night to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be. Disassemble a stolen car and sell parts on the internet. Prepare phones and tablets before selling them in a pawn shop by removing their security. Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Key near a window or purchase receipts in trash bins. All those things can make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren''t? Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, they will call the police. In this case hide and wait till they stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as possible.

Dual trackpads The Steam Controllerâ€˜s dual trackpads enable the high-fidelity input required for precise PC gaming in the living room.

Feel the spin of a virtual trackball, the click of a scroll wheel, or the shot of a rifle. Every input, from the triggers to the trackpads, can offer haptic feedback to your fingertips, delivering vital, high-bandwidth, tactile feedback about speed, boundaries, thresholds, textures, or actions. Dual-stage triggers With a satisfying digital click at the end of the trigger pull, dual-stage triggers can be used as analog, digital, or both types of input at the same time. Put your iron-sights on the sweep-in, and then fire with the reliable feel of a tactile switch, all on the same trigger.

Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful â€“ or functional â€“ healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses Donâ€™t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, youâ€™ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism â€“ each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. You can handle a single patient â€“ but can you handle a Pandemic? Once youâ€™ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Improve and expand your hospital horizons! Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Once youâ€™ve cured the residents of a small harbour village, can you take on a bigger challenge in a busier hospital? Improve your facilities, upgrade machines, staff and layouts to make more money, more quickly. Train and improve your staff, levelling them up with new skills and abilities to make your hospital even more efficient. Make use of the extensive statistic and information screens to analyse your strengths and weaknesses, and make rapid alterations. Adjust the price of your treatments, keep an eye on your turnover, take out loans and optimise your earnings. Youâ€™ll be managing staff with unique personality types and traits, so youâ€™ll need to keep an eye on whoâ€™s being efficient â€“ and who is just a pain in the neck. Balance your workforce with your ambitions as you strive to make profit (and hopefully save some people along the way). 	;;	2005-01-31	;;	51.66	;;	152	;;	4

Become the ultimate empire in The Universim, a new breed of God Game in development by Crytivo. Want to participate in Closed Alpha and Beta Tests of The Universim? Subscribe to the Newsletter and weâ€™ll let you know when the CBT begins! WANNA BE A GOD? Your time is coming. Guide a fledgling civilization through the obstacles of life. From humble beginnings, watch as they evolve and advance throughout the ages under your wing. Influence their decisions and punish the unfaithful with a wide range of godly abilities. Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit. This is your world, and nothing can stop you from having fun. Our goal is to bring back the features you know and love from classic god games and spice them up with fresh ideas, a modern physics engine, and stylized visuals developed by a few of our very own industry heroes. THE STORY OF A SPECIES Meet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. Youâ€™ve been warned. As you spend time with the Nuggets, You will see that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs - and they even have the ability to make their own decisions at times. We want to give you a feeling that youâ€™re interacting with a living organism, almost like youâ€™re messing around with a rather chaotic ant farm. ORGANIC GAMEPLAY Planets in The Universim arenâ€™t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planetâ€™s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world theyâ€™re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. Itâ€™s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization? These are living, breathing worlds where everything is interconnected. We aim to provide you with an unique experience unlike any of the god games you have played before. Every decision you or your civilization makes will have consequences. NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there! Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planetâ€™s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.  	;;	2018-06-13	;;	185.51	;;	36	;;	4

This new season moves the contest from the rugged, enclosed indoor arenas to the lush forests, rolling fields, and rugged terrains of TEC1â€™â€™s own private SCUM Island. Both fan favorites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers, producers, and corporate sponsors for fame, gifts, and a chance of life after death.

Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP â€˜network eventsâ€™ available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev blogs on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES [ALPHA] Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their characterâ€™s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 144 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Initially, the massive terrain will be handled by foot and as development continues vehicles will be introduced for quicker movement. PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1â€™s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive. Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island... Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

PrisonArchitect	;;	Build and Manage A Maximum Security Prison.	;;	About This Game  Purchase comes with the exclusive SteamBot3000 Character Skin with unique death animation, 2,000 Town Points ($8 Value) and you will earn double Merit Points forever! Town of Salem is a fresh innovation on the classic party games Mafia and Werewolf. It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play  The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don''t know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. Roles Town of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role''s abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/roles Game Phases Night The night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. Day The day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. Defense The defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows! Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging! Customization Players are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from. Achievements There are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game. Earning achievements will grant various in-game items (however the items for donation rewards are exclusive to Kickstarter).	;;	2016-01-08	;;	62.06	;;	153	;;	1

No game has come closer to the replication of the Age of Sail sailing mechanics and combat. Here is what you can expect: Beautiful ships â€“ We have been painstakingly recreating the beautiful ships of the Age of sail period. Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed trials were used in the creation of vessels. The game features 50+ ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates allowing the player to experience every possible role of that era. Conquest and PVP Activities Fight on War Server â€“ Fight for the domination of the West Indies, recreated based on 18th Century maps and navigational charts. Build ships, trade, attack enemies of your nation almost everywhere and capture their ships. Open trading outposts and levy taxes in the ports governed by your clan. Invest to turn your controlled ports into industrial hubs, shipbuilding arsenals or fortified harbours. Invite other clans of your nation into your alliance. Built for PVP Age of sail combat is a personal affair with no dirty tricks, corner camping, or hiding in bushes: you see the enemy from 20km and so do they. Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots.  Absolutely no hackers. Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes. Yes - you have heard it right: there is a special server that calculates and replicates waves to all users in battle. When fighting in Naval action you can be sure you are only facing skills and ship fittings. Other activities Relax on Peace Server - All nations are at peace and players cannot attack each other in Peace servers. There are no port battles and conquest, piracy or privateering. All ships can be captured from the NPCs. Peace servers are perfect for friendly peaceful gameplay.  Trading and privateering â€“ Buy trading goods at low prices, haul them to distant places for high profits. Board ships and sell them and their cargo at nearby ports. Use shallow waters at your advantage to escape from larger ships.  Admiralty missions â€“ Accomplish missions for your Admiralty to earn doubloons, combat medals and reward chests. Deliver cargo or passengers, hunt specific ships, join patrol zones battles and sink as many ships as you can. Tutorials â€“ In-game tutorials and exams help you to grasp the basics and the subtleties of gunnery and maneuvering. Passing the final naval combat exam grants you the rank of Master and Commander, together with a frigate and other rewards to start your adventures in the West Indies. Features Realistic sailing â€“ Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of shipâ€™s performance in the age of sail. Yard angles, ship angle to wind, fittings and ship condition affects speeds and turning rates. Correct tacking, boxhauling, clubhauling and other elements of realistic sailing will help you win battles in most adverse conditions.  Gunnery and weapons â€“  Major types of naval artillery are implemented: from long guns to mortars to carronades and obusiers. Fort and land batteries will provide you with support during battles near shores. Mortar vessels can destroy fortifications, though they may require an escort. Each gun has realistic ballistics and penetration performance based on historical gun charts and admiralty tests.. Heel and wind affects the shooting distance and will require a change in tactics.  Damage model â€“ Every cannonball is tracked in the air and after it hits the target. Leaks, structural damage, torn sails, demasting, raking, fires, explosions and all other hazards that were possible in that era. Damage is positional: hit the gun and you might destroy it. Gunnery crews are placed deck by deck. Shot can pass through the balcony, ricochet of the gun, hit a crew member and then fly out of the gunport splashing into the water. Armor thickness and wood types affect strength of the hull and cannonballs will ricochet from the hulls at extreme angles.  Customization â€“ Choose economy and battle perks as you progress through higher ranks. Loot or craft the shipbuilding woods that fit the characteristics you want to give to your future ship. Find knowledge books in enemy vessels and build upgrades to improve the performance of your ship.	;;	2001-11-01	;;	69.29	;;	9	;;	5

CallofDuty:ModernWarfare3	;;	The best-selling first-person action series of all-time returns with an epic sequel to the multiple GOTY award winner Call of DutyÂ®: Modern WarfareÂ® 2	;;	About This Game  The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It''s kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you''ll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. Survival or Sandbox? The Isle''s core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don''t want to struggle to survive, or you don''t have the time to go through a dinosaur''s whole life story. And that''s okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won''t judge. A Global Community Story The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game''s storyline. Future Development Goals We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: Playable aquatic and aerial creatures Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles Two new playable factions: modern humans & the indigenous Evolve into advanced ''strain'' versions of certain dinosaurs Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours Additional world biome types such as thick jungles Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system Global in-game world quest Localization of all in-game menus & text Better accessibility & customization options Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes Mod support using Steam Workshop All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received-- --End Promotional Protocol-- --SiGnaL InTeRrUpt-- -tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev -	;;	2006-06-22	;;	178.33	;;	113	;;	5

Customize your troops'' appearance your way, by selecting their portrait, outfit, colors and overall visuals from a wide selection. Equip your army with over 240 pieces of equipment, either purchased, gathered from fallen enemies or created from crafting. Centuries ago, a brutal beast of destruction rent the world asunder. In this time of need, the first Immortals came into their uncanny powers, powers so great that they succeeded in destroying the beast ravaging the land, where all else had failed. To prevent such destruction from ever happening again, the Immortals banded together to form a Council that would enforce order and stability on a global scale, stepping in at any hint of war or chaos. The Immortals might be vastly powerful, but they are few. Even they can''t oversee all of the lands. This is why they rely upon their mortal agents, the Arbiters, to guard the land''s people from the more day-to-day dangers they face. Arbiters range over the land, rooting out bandits, unruly monsters, and crooked officials; their word is law. But one Arbiter uncovers the deepening corruption pervading her own order, and it falls to her to halt the spread of a threat as dire as the brutal beast of yore. Strongly influenced by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics (original and Advance versions) and Tactics Ogre, this tactical RPG stands on its own as a worthy successor of those classics, bringing a slew of improvements and additions to the tactics genre.	;;	2008-05-18	;;	41.13	;;	143	;;	1

Their goal is to stop the survivors from escaping without being identified and killed. Teamwork Survivors cannot escape unless they work together. Players who wander off on their own will have difficulty surviving the elements, can fall victim to hostile wildlife, or become easy targets for the traitors. Communication There are several ways to communicate with other players, including proximity-based voice chat, private voice chat radio channels, text chat, and emotes - communication is key if the survivors have any hope of completing their tasks and defending against the traitors. Betrayal & Deception The traitors are outnumbered and weak when the game begins, they may infiltrate the survivors and earn their trust while they build up their strength. Survivors can never be 100% sure of who to trust. The traitors can take advantage of this by spreading lies, and pitting the survivors against each other. 	;;	2011-09-27	;;	14.03	;;	136	;;	3

Gameplay: Prepare for true high-stakes platforming, where you have to use your mind to triumph! On your vertical adventure tension will rise with each jump, even though you cannot die!

You will have to consider each situation carefully before you jump, because once you are in the air there is no way to turn back!   Atmosphere: Leap through an intriguing world and meet curious characters along your way. Hand-drawn backgrounds and distinct animations paint a rare picture, while the blend of retro sfx, beautiful arrangements and high definition ambiences give a peculiar atmosphere - thanks to composers/sound designers Nils EklÃ¶f and Elias ThÃ¶rnlund.

EndlessSpace2	;;	Endless Space 2 is a Strategic Space Opera, featuring the compelling â€œjust one more turnâ€ gameplay, set in the mysterious Endless universe. As the leader of your civilization, will you impose your vision and build the greatest stellar empire?	;;	About This Game The goal of KovaaK''s FPS Aim Trainer is to enable players to create their own training with realistic dodging targets. Every mechanic within the game is driven by user-defined profiles - Weapons, characters, abilities, bots, how bots dodge, how bots aim, challenges, and more are all configurable by hundreds of variables. All of these profiles can be saved and distributed in a single scenario file. Hone your muscle memory in the trainer, apply it in game. Game features: Play scenarios directly from the Steam workshop (30+ before release, 850+ a year later) to jump right in and practice your FPS skills Highly responsive input from a tweaked Unreal Engine 4 that has the approval of many top Quake players and Overwatch grand masters who have tested and provided feedback over the last year All the configuration options you''d expect of a competitive FPS (FOV, separate horizontal/vertical mouse sensitivity, unlocked frame rate, per-weapon config settings, custom crosshairs, and much more) Create your own weapons Create your own characters Create bots Tell the bots how to dodge Tell the bots how to aim Make challenges to practice specific scenarios similar to your favorite FPS All profiles can be edited in-game or with text editors. Upload your own creations to the Steam workshop for others to practice. Compete on the Leaderboards for any and every scenario on the Steam workshop. (global or friends only) Custom maps (note FPSAimTrainer does not include a map editor, but rather reads Reflex''s map format thanks to the wonderful developers at TurboPixelStudio. Reflex is available on Steam now and includes a fully featured map editor as well as awesome Arena FPS gameplay) Custom crosshairs (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.) Visual customizations (Floors/wall textures from a large list; bodies and heads of characters can be set to RGB values, differentiated by team; attacks can be set to the colors of characters) Mouse sensitivity scaled to popular games including Quake/Source, Overwatch, Paladins, Rainbow Six Siege, Battalion 1944, and Reflex. Singleplayer only. Sorry, multiplayer is too much for this solo developer. More profile related features and abilities are planned to allow players to emulate features from even more FPS games, but the existing options are extremely flexible as is. As the developer, I consider FPS Aim Trainer a tool that I will be using well into the future. My goal is to keep it relevant to gamers as long as I can. Among my top priorities: advanced movement mechanics such as bunnyhopping and strafe jumping, graph/histogram to look at your scores and accuracies over time, bot types of player-recorded paths, and simulated network lag. Running Unreal Engine 4, all graphical options that affect framerate or input lag have been disabled by default. Literally every console command was investigated to see whether any more performance could be eeked out of the engine, because you can never have enough frames per second when you are training for competitive FPSs. As such, the graphics of the game at release will not improve, although things like more options for weapon models and floor/wall textures are planned down the line.	;;	2013-03-06	;;	84.22	;;	176	;;	5

StickFight:TheGame	;;	Stick Fight is a physics-based couch/online fighting game where you battle it out as the iconic stick figures from the golden age of the internet.	;;	About This Game  Rising Storm 2: Vietnam is the next in the series that has twice been PC Gamerâ€™s â€˜Multiplayer Game of the Yearâ€™ , bringing the franchise into the era of automatic rifles, man-portable grenade launchers and more modern weapons systems. Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 â€œHueyâ€: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 â€œLoachâ€: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G â€œCobraâ€: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian â€œBushrangerâ€: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 â€œgrease gunâ€, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the Peopleâ€™s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordces (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forcesâ€™ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their â€œhome field advantageâ€, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover canâ€™t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right â€œHo Chi Minh Trailâ€ ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his teamâ€™s spawning rate, when times get desperate â€œAmbush Spawnâ€ ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps 	;;	2005-08-11	;;	180.12	;;	40	;;	3

THE STORY - DIVE INTO AN ENGAGING DYSTOPIAN ADVENTURE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE  Water is life. Someone shouldâ€™ve made that clear before humanity started poisoning Earth with microplastics. Now water is death. People are fighting for drinkable water, for survival. The military tried their best to keep order, but inevitably they got overwhelmed. Thatâ€™s when mercenaries appeared.. then entire private armies.. and then when hope started to fade away came the religious cults. The most fearsome of all is a secretive organization worshipping Tlaloc, the aztec God of rain. The â€œTlalokiiâ€, as they call themselves. Their motto? â€œJoin us or perishâ€. What is even worse, they know something that can change the fate of humanity. Be part of this action-packed, story-driven VR adventure where you fight alongside your fellow soldiers trying to keep orderâ€¦ or whatâ€™s left of it anyway.

TrainSimulator2019	;;	Ever dreamed of driving trains? Now you can! Train Simulator 2019 brings to life some amazing train challenges on real world routes and delivers the ultimate railway hobby.	;;	About This Game Kingdoms and Castles is a game about growing a kingdom from a tiny hamlet to a sprawling city and imposing castle. Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants'' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you''ve built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you''re settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter.  A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests. Kingdoms and Castles is the first Fig funded game to be released. Its crowd funding campaign succeeded with 725% of its goal and was supported by 1,400 backers. Supporters of the game could both pledge and invest during the Fig campaign.	;;	2012-07-10	;;	47.28	;;	66	;;	2

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG. drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG. drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be. Why is BeamNG. drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG. drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG. drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don''t let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG. drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn''t force you to do anything that you don''t think is fun or interesting. The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane''s airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge. Alpha Access Features  All future updates to BeamNG. drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game  Soft-body physics sandbox  19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come  10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come  Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes  Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay  Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software  Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run. Alpha Testers Users that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key. Our goals Our main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL. Our mission To have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.

KnightsofPenandPaper2	;;	Prepare to inhabit a world of chivalry, class warfare and off-beat pop references. Knights of Pen & Paper 2 is a turn-based, retro style, pixel-art adventure full of danger, intrigue, death, and saving throws!	;;	About This Game  Free Demo Available Here A free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No ''hero'' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You''re not great and powerful. You don''t have more ''hitpoints'' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won''t stop moving. This is not just a ''game\", you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don''t change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won''t hold your hand or help you when you''re down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A characterâ€™s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic. 	;;	2016-01-25	;;	89.09	;;	31	;;	5

CROSSOUT - The Road to Apocalypse In 2027 a mysterious viral epidemic known as the â€˜Crossoutâ€™ swept the planet, countries and populations simultaneously began to fall at an alarming rate all over the Earth. Those who did not die in the first few days, were plagued by hallucinations and headaches, many people went mad, others and committed suicide. The source of the disease could not be detected but the cities that were once the vibrant social and economic beacons of humanity were left ravaged and deserted. Survivors gradually began to change â€” after fifteen years of transformation, the changes became visible. The most noticeable metamorphosis occurred in the eyes of the affected â€” some began to glow, while others resembled black holes. To hide their unnatural looks and conceal the mutation, people started wearing padded clothing and sunglasses. Twenty years have passed after â€˜Crossoutâ€™. Humans still remember their life before the disaster. As always, there are groups trying to recover the old world, while others enjoy the chaos and destruction. But there are those who are not human any more. They hide their faces behind masks, and their motives are unknown.	;;	2017-12-22	;;	186.70	;;	101	;;	4

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica''s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof osuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

Playtime: ~12-25h - Metroidvania - You explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles.

If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger. - Exploration - Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets. Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer, but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland respects your lifetime and doesn''t bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles. - Puzzle Design - The deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles you''ve never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process. And it''s important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution. - Fighting - The fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading. - Free Demo - In the demo you can play the first big section of the game and decide if it''s for you.

To activate VR mode please download this free DLC: PAYDAY 2: VR PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid â€“ Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET â€“ The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician ''The Elephant\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level â€“ Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios â€“ No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills â€“ As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever â€“ PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications â€“ A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you''ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way â€“ Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly. New Game Content All the Time â€“ More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017. 	;;	2006-05-23	;;	27.61	;;	157	;;	3

Each map is designed with colour-coded areas as well as plentiful landmarks such as statues, paintings and furniture that allow you to quickly locate other players without being able to actually see them. Inspired by games like Towerfall we''ve provided players with a highly granular level of customisation to play the game the way they want to. Choose which weapons you''ll allow, how and when they can be swapped or reloaded, apply time limits, adjust the victory conditions, penalties and more. To really mix it up stack on some Mutators such as slow mode, low gravity or flappy jump.	;;	2008-10-30	;;	85.60	;;	27	;;	4
MinionMasters	;;	The dead stir and terror stalks the skies! The Bones & Bravery Update is here, featuring brand-new faction mechanics and the largest Minion to date. Summon your very own undead dragon!	;;	About This Game  Space Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive.

Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed.

Craft your unique battle machines from dozens of interchangeable parts and destroy your enemies in explosive PvP online battles!	;;	About This Game  It was said that the natural enemy of all living things would be destroyed by the emissaries of night, the dark elves. ''You finally found your way here, huh?\" mutters the blue-haired elf. ''I said that I''d bring you back, didn''t I?\" replies the elf with golden hair, but as she does, the woman silently shakes her head. ''I''m glad that I got to see you one last time.\" she speaks softly with a smile on her face while stroking the golden hair of the other elf. The two elven knights have lived through harsh times. They were separated and reunited on multiple occasions, but have at last made their way here. In this nameless church where no one has been, what are they thinking?  What have they left behind? ''This was my only choice...\" Clacier, who became a knight to live. ''I have something that I need to accomplish no matter what. I''m here because it''s necessary to reach that goal.\" said Annette, who also became a knight for a very important goal. The story begins several years prior, before the two had yet become knights.

Customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities. Meet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. Youâ€™ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and youâ€™ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.

While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins â€” and while dealing with politics in your own court. Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with.

FORHONOR	;;	Carve a path of destruction through an intense, believable battlefield in For Honor.	;;	About This Game  Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships youâ€™ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage.. Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the shipâ€™s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Donâ€™t worry though, as any crafting progress youâ€™ve made is retained from one to another.	;;	2018-06-11	;;	15.52	;;	51	;;	3

After creating many action games, this is a new project from Team Ladybug. Story \"--Now, let''s begin my world.\" The vampire from the Scarlet Devil Mansion ,\"Remilia Scarlet,\" suddenly sends her maid, ''Sakuya Izayoi'' to a parallel universe similar to Gensokyo. A strange world, strange youkai, and unable to use the power to manipulate time. What is Remilia up toâ€¦â€¦? What''s special about this game ãƒ»Time stop system from character''s Ability and Gimmick maps that use special abilities like time stop. ãƒ»Adapt the ''graze'' system of the Touhou Project into a 2D game, giving you a sense of tension in approaching to the enemy. ãƒ»Graphics that bring out the appeal of Touhou world, such as attractive dot Graphics. A word from the publisher Team Ladybug began with ''Pharaoh Rebirth,\" continuing with other enjoyable games including ''Resurrection of Beldia'' and ''Shin Megami Tensei SYNCHRONICITY PROLOGUE.\" Since, I have been waiting in anticipation for their next project. This time, they have created a fan fiction game based off the world-renowned ''Touhou Project.\" From the background to the character''s movements and various skills, one can feel the creator''s passion for games and love of the Touhou project. While it is a 2D search game similar to Castlevania, the game can easily progress without the insistence of repeat elements or collecting items. This has resulted in a spectacular game born from the game production skills cultivated by Team Ladybug. And I personally want to highlight the beauty of the anime sprite. You can see the attention to detail the creator put into not only the leading character''s movements, but the effects and enemy characters. Touhou Luna Night''s is not only for Touhou fans but one that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves 2D action games.	;;	2002-09-08	;;	172.00	;;	163	;;	1

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists'' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. Itâ€™s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the â€œrandomâ€ events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers â€“ theyâ€™re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. Youâ€™ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each personâ€™s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill â€“ but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they''ll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You''re not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they''re too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters'' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer''s leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino''s horn, and it''s much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he''ll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there''s much more than that!

Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for domice and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombit genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARKâ€™s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ''Engrams'' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you''ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ''Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, youâ€™ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK''s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique ''Procedurally Generated ARKs\', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Factorio	;;	Factorio is a game about building and creating automated factories to produce items of increasing complexity, within an infinite 2D world. Use your imagination to design your factory, combine simple elements into ingenious structures, and finally protect it from the creatures who don''t really like you.	;;	About This Game Savage, nightmarish monsters roam the Louisiana swamps, and you are part of a group of rugged bounty hunters bound to rid the world of their ghastly presence. Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generouslyâ€”and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of huntersâ€”called your Bloodlineâ€”always. HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION Huntâ€™s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, depending on whether you have chosen team play or solo play, up to five teams of two or ten solo players set out to track their monstrous targets. Once theyâ€™ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bountyâ€”and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you donâ€™t watch your back, youâ€™ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the rewardâ€“but a single mistake could cost you everything. Hunt''s Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match, during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down to complete the missionâ€”while the other Hunters attempt to take them out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish. PROGRESSION Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. DARK SIGHT Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape.	;;	2004-06-08	;;	122.58	;;	146	;;	3

TheElderScrollsV:SkyrimVR	;;	A true, full-length open-world game for VR has arrived from Bethesda Game Studios. Skyrim VR reimagines the complete epic fantasy masterpiece with an unparalleled sense of scale, depth, and immersion. Skyrim VR also includes all official add-ons.	;;	About This Game  SpaceEngine is a 1:1 scale science-based Universe simulator, featuring billions upon billions of galaxies, nebulae, stars, and planets, all shown at their full real-world scale. Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions. All of time and space are yours to explore â€“ cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky â€“ stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae â€“ are yours to explore at the press of a button. Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons â€“ create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others. With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless. SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities: Astronomy All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems. Controls You are free to move around the universe â€“ travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as ''click and go\", as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls. Graphics Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer''s GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets. Physics Realistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics. Virtual reality SpaceEngine supports HTC Vive, Oculus Rift (via native library), and Windows Mixed Reality (via Steam VR). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR. Sound Original background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development. Tools Built-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in â€œWikiâ€ info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools. Multi-language support Currently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Catalan languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game. Modding SpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships. Spacecraft models, representing both real and fictional designs â€“ including from popular sci-fi franchises â€“ are commonly imported and shared by the community, both here on Steam and on the official SpaceEngine forum. 	;;	2013-04-22	;;	68.83	;;	59	;;	1

Don''tStarveTogether	;;	Don''t Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer expansion of the uncompromising survival game Don''t Starve.	;;	About This Game From the co-creator of Rick and Morty comes Trover Saves the Universe. Your dogs have been dognapped by a beaked lunatic named Glorkon who stuffed them into his eye holes and is using their life essence to destroy the universe. You''re partnered with Trover, a little purple eye-hole monster who isnâ€™t a huge fan of working or being put in the position of having to save the universe. Heâ€™s also not that big a fan of you quite frankly, and neither am I. (Jk, youâ€™re great) Only you and Trover can save everything in this bizarre comedy adventure, created by Justin Roiland! A comedy adventure filled with combat, platforming, puzzles, and morally questionable choices. See how the best intentions can go horribly awry. You control Trover''s movements , but not his mouth. Heâ€™s got a lot to say about whatâ€™s going on in the game. Travel the cosmos to experience a variety of weird alien planets and bizarre characters with big personalities. Upgrade Trover AND YOURSELF with new abilities to (hopefully) defeat Glorkon while evading awkward situations. You''ll be immersed in weirdness , no matter which display you use -- play on TV, monitor or VR headset displays. 	;;	2004-08-05	;;	175.21	;;	178	;;	2

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed.  Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.  The Survivors'' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com Key Features â€¢ Survive Togetherâ€¦ Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone.

Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. â€¢ A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killerâ€™s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. â€¢ Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. â€¢ Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how itâ€™s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience.

The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex â€“ and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nighâ€¦ Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill. 	;;	2020-12-11	;;	40.69	;;	59	;;	5

If someone on your friends list gets their character captured, and they aren''t able to rescue them, maybe you can! You''ll sometimes get a character whose personal goal is to rescue a friend''s character. If you manage it, you unlock your friend''s character to play as! They don''t get it back. They had their chance. It''s yours now. Find your friends'' items! When you retire an accomplished character, you can choose one item to pass on. You get to name it, and both your Steam friends and your own future characters have a chance to find these as loot. Equally, you''ll come across items your friends have named. What Heat Signature is not: We don''t want you to buy Heat Signature if it''s not for you. We''d always rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. So here''s what it isn''t: - It''s not story-driven: there''s a backstory to this place and a few conversations with characters, but there''s not a story that develops as you play. It''s much more about the stories you generate by playing, about how you got out of impossible situation X or pulled off crazy stunt Y. There aren''t other careers: You can''t mine asteroids. You can''t build ships. You can''t recruit a crew. You''re an infiltrator, you break into spaceships for a living, it''s all about that. There are no planets: The whole game takes place in this nebula full of space stations. You can dock at any friendly station and board any hostile ship, but it''s not a space exploration game. It''s not multiplayer: The friends features mentioned above are fun but they''re just sharing content, it''s not multiplayer at all and you''re never in the same world together. There are cool games about all those things. This is a cool game about something else!	;;	2003-04-05	;;	4.49	;;	170	;;	5

Created by hardcore gamers, Path of Exile is an online Action RPG set in a dark fantasy world.	;;	About This Game Half a year after the events of Trails in the Sky Second Chapter , Liberl has settled into peace once againâ€”but even during peaceful times, there are many among the distinguished and fortunate burning with greed thanks to the influence of ancient artifacts. Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing oneâ€™s faith in the Goddess.  On the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral. Whatâ€™s more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.  Thus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberlâ€™s future will be laid bareâ€¦and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.

Maybe you prefer the challenge of sailing across the Southern Oceans enduring the fiercest storms they have to offer? Or you just wish to learn to sail but have no access to a boat to do so? With Sailaway you can do all of these things. Sailaway - The Sailing Simulator brings all the world''s oceans to the comfort of your PC or Mac for you to experience the ultimate in online virtual sailing! In Sailaway, the oceans of the planet have been recreated with unparalleled accuracy; making a trip across the Pacific take months, just as it would on a real boat. With a persistent online world, adjust your settings and your boat will continue to sail even if you arenâ€™t online.  Receive updates via email as your boat continues its progress, but don''t forget to check in often â€“ with real-time weather data pulled from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conditions can change in just a few hours. Sailaway gives players the most realistic digital sailing experience to date with in-depth simulations of weather, wind and currents while your boat and itâ€™s sail are modelled to give even the most experienced sailor a work-out. The early difficulty modes will let you sail away while you learn the game and then it truly comes alive when the virtual help is removed and itâ€™s you against the forces of nature. If youâ€™re going to beat your friends then youâ€™ll need to plot your course and constantly monitor your sailâ€™s shape, use any slight advantage to help you arrive first! Sailaway includes a variety of lovingly created boats for you to sail the world in, these can all be customised in hundreds of combinations using the provided options or by uploading your own textures for that extra something special! With Steam Workshop integration you can then share these designs with other sailors to enjoy. 38â€² Cruiser A 38'' cruiser with good performance. With all the trim lines a sailor would desire. Mini-Transat A tiny boat for experienced sailors. It sails like a dinghy and is very fast on a reach. With all the sails and trim lines you''ll need. Caribbean Rose The beautiful lines and craftsmanship of antique boats are reflected in the Caribbean Rose. Easy to sail, with a long keel. Cruising Catamaran The ideal boat for exploring the Pacific Islands. Easy to sail, little heel and solid as a rock. 50'' Performance Cruiser A very fast boat, that could almost pass for a racer. For experienced sailors who know how to push a boat to the limit. Nordic Folkboat A small, but fierce boat with lots of character. Ideal for learning how to sail, because it only has a mainsheet and a rudder to control. 32'' Offshore Racer Foiling monohull for club races. Itâ€™s fast, challenging and exciting. The foils increase stability and reduce drift. The ocean can sometimes feel like a lonely place which is why Sailaway includes plenty of ways to enjoy activities with friends and strangers alike. Real-time global, local and group chat will allow you to communicate freely with other sailors to organise your own voyages or even to just pass on sailing tips! Invite others to your boat to help tackle the voyage ahead or if you fancy some friendly competition you can invite them along with their boat to sail alongside each other, we make it easy to share the sailing experience with others. If competitive racing is more your thing then we also have you covered, Sailaway lets you take part in races across the globe! Record your finish times in our online leaderboards and challenge one another for the top spot. Maybe you have the creativity to design your own races? Sailaway allows all its sailors to create races for others to compete in via its Player Created Races feature. Sailaway has been designed to accurately simulate the wonders of sailing as realistically as possible, which means all the little details count! Real Sail Trim Every control you would expect to find on a real sailboat is here to use in Sailaway, you will be using sheets and trim lines to optimize the shape of your sails and gain every second you can on your journey or race. Real Weather The clouds, wind, fog, rain and snow are all simulated according to the real weather as provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This means you can use actual weather predictions from your favorite weather service to plan your journey. Real Waves Sailaway simulates the waves accurately, taking the history of wind direction and wind speed into account, as well as current, water depth and nearby islands or shallow areas. The North Sea has different waves than the Atlantic Ocean or South Pacific and each present their own set of challenges. Real Water The colour of the water you sail upon is affected by a great many things, from the blue of pure water to the brownish colour of muddy rivers. Sailaway adjusts water colour by depth and other influences before it renders a single drop of water to make it as realistic as possible. Real Sky Our ancestors navigated by the stars which is why we made sure the positions of the sun, moon, planets and stars are all correct. There is even a handy feature that highlights the constellations but just like in the real world if the sky happens to be cloudy there will be nothing to see but darkness. Real Maps To aid navigation there is an interactive map that can zoom from world scale to small coves, displaying deep and shallow areas, rocks, buoys, lights and everything you need for a safe journey.	;;	2018-02-12	;;	64.08	;;	32	;;	5

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or ''tug of war\". Ambush --- A high value target (\"HVT\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It''s one team''s goal to make this happen and it''s the other team''s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team''s goal is to take the enemy''s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy''s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team''s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy''s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.	;;	2013-09-10	;;	172.98	;;	47	;;	2

No game subscription required.	;;	About This Game  In an alternate reality in 1920s Europa, it''s been several years since the ''Great War\", but the ashes of the conflict are still hot and the war is entering a new phase. The first conflict saw the emergence of some incredible engines of war known as Mechs. Built by ''The Factory\", an independent city-state which has since become the object of everyone''s desire, these technological monstrosities roam the snowy landscapes of Europa. Be the hero of one of the five factions â€“ Saxony Empire, Crimean Khanate, Rusviet Union, Polania Republic or Nordic Kingdom â€“ and become the richest and most powerful nation in all of Europa during these dark times! To assure the victory of your people, you will need to explore and conquer new territories, enlist new recruits and deploy your forces by building formidable and terrifying combat Mechs. Replay history in a fictional past full of mechanical engines and technology, where each choice you make will be critical. Choose your battles with care, because in Scythe, victory is achieved with and for the people! Asymmetry: every player starts the game with different resources (energy, coins, keen combat sense, popularityâ€¦), a different starting location and a secret objective. The starting positions are specifically set to contribute to the uniqueness of every faction and the asymmetrical nature of the game. Strategy: Scythe offers players almost complete control over their fate. The only elements of chance apart from each player''s individual secrete objective card are the Encounter cards, which players draw to interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Combat is also handled by way of choice; no luck or chance is involved. Engine Building: Players can improve their construction abilities to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits into their faction, activate mechs to dissuade opponents from invading and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. This aspect creates a feeling of energy and progression over the course of the entire game. The order in which players get to develop their economy and technologies adds to the unique feel of every game, even when playing as the same faction several times. 	;;	2000-02-07	;;	13.07	;;	190	;;	4

Components snake along conveyor belts to a ''just-in-time'' ordering system that leaves no pauses, no delay, no confusion or congestion. Nothing exists but the perfect flowing efficiency of high tech car construction... ...in theory. In practice, of course, life is not so simple. When you get to grips with your first factory design, it certainly will not feel in a state of pure flow...or profit for that matter. Making a handful of built-to-order cars and breaking even is one thing...but competing with the big multinationals and churning out thousands of cars for the mass market is a whole new ballgame. To win market share from the big companies you are going to need planning, an appreciation of future technology, a careful eye on your bottom line, and an ability to design a factory layout that makes use of every square meter, and cuts production costs per car to the absolute minimum. Have you got what it takes to win? Production line is the new car factory management/simulation/tycoon game from Positech Games, the developers of Democracy & Gratuitous Space Battles, and publishers of Big Pharma. This game is designed to appeal to the efficiency geek in all of us, the person who cannot help but organize things for maximum performance. The closet entrepreneur, the stats-geek,  Is that you? if so...welcome to your dream game (we hope!) The key to understanding production line is the division of labor and the merits of purpose-built machinery. At the start, your factory will be small and the individual slots on your production line will carry out large complex tasks (like fitting the car body). As you research better methods, and earn the funds to expand, you will continue to subdivide those slots into smaller (and faster) production areas which keep the flow of new vehicles flowing smoothly. At the same time, product design researchers will be working out how to enhance your cars with new technologies such as automatic headlights, power steering, bluetooth phone support and voice recognition. its a race to be productive AND a race to be profitable. Are you ready to compete?	;;	2002-05-03	;;	140.03	;;	138	;;	5

PinballFX3	;;	Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation Gold bundle	;;	About This Game The Game:  Here is a sandbox like no other. Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don''t recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!  The Technology:  Unfortunately there really aren''t many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn''t stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it''s true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it''s surroundings and effects the overall lighting.  Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!	;;	2020-05-19	;;	19.10	;;	101	;;	2

We''ve previously combined one of our games with another genre or game. The first year we made Supertruck, a mix between the game Superhot and Clustertruck. Last year we made TABZ which is a mix of TABS and DAY-Z. We spend an enormous amount of lunch breaks and nights playing battle royale games, this is an homage to a genra we love. Why are you making another game? Shouldn''t you be working on TABS? We didnâ€™t take much time away from TABS, we took some time to work on TABG because we wanted to bring you something while you wait for TABS. We knew that TABZ last year, and Supertruck the year before was very appreciated by our community and thought weâ€™d keep up the tradition by making yet another game for you to play. Why are you releasing it in June and not April? We had some networking issues but were determined to finish up the game to share it with you all!	;;	2006-02-08	;;	5.44	;;	164	;;	5

TomClancyâ™sTheDivision	;;	Distance is an atmospheric racing platformer. Fusing futuristic arcade racing with parkour, survive a deadly, mysterious, neon-drenched city by jumping, rotating, and flying.	;;	About This Game XERA: Survival is an action-focused looter-shooter, designed from the ground up as a multiplayer, open world PvPvE experience with a global gear stash you can access from any server. 2022: The era of AI has arrived. The world is in chaos after a prototype combat robot - banned by law and awaiting secure destruction by XERA Corporation - became self-aware, escaped and began replication on an industrial scale. Failed attempts to remotely shut down the AI simply triggered a war that humanity could not afford to lose.  Nation turned on nation in a fight for control over resources to defend against the robots. With the attention of the worldâ€™s military elsewhere, disenfranchised operatives have gathered to ransack what was left of the XERA facilities, setting up two forward operating bases, safe zones on each side of the forest that was the hiding place for mankindâ€™s greatest failure of leadership.  Between these bases there are no rules of engagement, as for some, nothing less than the future of the human race is at stake; for some there is a potentially boundless paycheck; and for others perhaps, political leverage. For all, the only imperative is survival.  But then again, no one expected the robots to be waiting. MULTIPLAYER WITH PERSISTENT GLOBAL INVENTORY  XERA: Survival has been built from the ground up as a multiplayer game you can play with your friends or against others from all around the world - the choice is yours. Store your gear safely in a persistent global inventory. Log out from an American server, and access all your items on a European server. Venture out on raids using your selected load-out with friends, or meet players from all over the world! We have servers operating in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. Communication is important in any multiplayer game. Whether you''re screaming â€œIâ€™m friendly!â€ or taunting your enemies - you will be heard. With directional support, you can pinpoint where the voice is coming from. PLAYER VS PLAYER VS ENVIRONMENT Venture out in search of glory, revenge, salvation, leverage - or hard cash. Scavenge for weapons, ammo, food and water, medical supplies; craft the tools you need to survive a harsh and unforgiving forest environment. Deploy drones to scout, transport â€“ or close the business a bullet left unfinished. And when youâ€™re ready to stash your loot â€“ just make it back alive to either of the safe forward operating bases. CHOOSE YOUR OWN PACE (FARM OR FIGHT!) Use the cover of darkness to avoid PvP combat, build your resources and focus on PvE takedowns to scavenge the best loot. In the base you can trade safely with other players, or save to your server-side stash. Alternatively, you can choose to tool up and raid as a lone wolf or teamed with buddies, dropping where you want in the 4x4km world using regular helicopter insertions from the bases or on foot. Take part in giant PvPvE compound events or missions you pick up from NPCs back in the base. And all the while, lose just the equipment you brought with you in the event you meet an untimely death. DYNAMIC DAY / NIGHT AND WEATHER SYSTEMS  The day and night cycle in XERA: Survival adds variation to game play. In darkness, itâ€™s easier to avoid other players and scavenge the best loot. But beware, different robot variations come out at night â€“ faster and harder to kill. Weigh up your choices carefullyâ€¦  A realistic weather system has been implemented which adds further dynamic elements to combat and survival. Your tactics will need to change depending on the weather conditions. LIVE LONGER AND PROSPER  Earn XP in game from looting, participating in events, killing robots and so on. Levelling up unlocks enhanced skills, for example inflicting more PvE damage or being harder to spot by robots. You can gain improved medical treatment abilities or even drone buffs, besides opening up new recipes for crafting and an increased stash size. TOOLS OF THE TRADE  Weapons you can uncover in XERA: Survival include sniper rifles, a range of assault rifles and submachine guns, plus pistols and course their ammo. Medical supplies, backpacks, food and drink all play important roles â€“ and of course many items can be crafted from looted material. Drones â€“ whatâ€™s not to like? They can be used for a range of purposes, and have upgrade paths as your skills improve.  The world''s loot system constantly spawns fresh gear around the map, so roaming is your best option for finding more equipment. Just make sure you make it back to one of the basesâ€¦ COMMUNITY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT  Following an extended open Alpha period, XERA: Survival is now entering Early Access. We are committed to a fair business model for our players â€“ you wonâ€™t find us selling bullets or introducing any punitive monetization. Cosmetic upgrades can be earned in game and may be purchasable via in-game transactions. XERA: Survival is developed by Spotted Kiwi Interactive, an independent development company based in the deep south of New Zealand (Aotearoa) with team members around the world. We have a community-focused development ethos and though we have a clear vision for the game through Early Access, we will always be open to suggestions from our players.	;;	2013-07-19	;;	126.51	;;	196	;;	4

Draugen	;;	Aseprite is a pixel-art tool to create 2D animations, sprites, and any kind of graphics for games.	;;	About This Game  Avorion is currently in Early Access, and under active development. If you want to know more about that, please read the Early Access disclaimer at the top of the page. Several hundred years ago, a cataclysmic catastrophe nearly ripped your galaxy apart - an insurmountable ring of torn hyperspace fabric appeared in the center of the galaxy, which normal hyperspace engines canâ€™t overcome. Since this event nobody has managed to get near the central regions of the galaxy. All you know is that this event also spawned multiple insurmountable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy, and that a strange race of aliens, the Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to surpass the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them. There are also rumors about a strange new metal called â€˜Avorionâ€™, which has appeared in the center of the galaxy, around the same time as the Xsotan arrived. Apparently the aliens use this material to build their ships. Start out as a nobody at the edge of the galaxy and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they''re hit in space fights. Combat Equip your ship with chainguns, lasers and other weaponry to take on your enemies and enjoy the sight of completely destructible ships breaking at the exact points where you hit them. Defend your allies from pirates, hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions. Build hangars and command squads of fighters in your battles or destroy enemy freighters to steal their cargo. Explore Fly through beautiful nebulas and dense asteroid fields in search of hidden treasures and meet the many factions that populate and control their portion of the galaxy. Each faction has its own characteristics, such as peaceful, intelligent or aggressive, and has its own ship styles, meaning their ships and stations have a distinct look. Explore the galaxy at your own pace to find valuable goods in old ship wreckages, undiscovered asteroid fields rich of resources, unchartered asteroids which you can claim for yourself, or clues as to what happened during the event a few hundred years back. Build Your Fleet There are no limits to ship size or complexity besides your resources. You''re not bound to the standard voxel style and while building an awesome ship in Avorion you won''t get lost in lots and lots of micro-management. You can focus on building a great looking ship, without having too much trouble to make it work. But make sure you still keep an eye on your shipâ€™s maneuverability and energy requirements. Adjust your ships perfectly to their operational purpose by building light and agile or heavily armored ships. Build specialized transport ships with lots of cargo space or heavily armored battleships with strong shields. Collect loot from defeated foes which you can use to upgrade your ship: New turrets, resources, trading goods or system upgrades. Install system upgrades that allow more weapons, ease asteroid mining or trading systems which detect trading routes over multiple sectors. And why build only one ship? Hire captains to fly your ships for you, manage your crews, weapons, hangars and fighters and build your own fleet of space ships! Trade Extend your ship with a cargo bay, find profitable deals and haul over a hundred trading goods through the galaxy to make a profit and buy your way up the food chain: Build up a trading corporation and extend your influence in the galaxy by founding asteroid mines and factories that attract NPC traders who will buy and sell their goods at your establishments. Co-op Multiplayer You don''t have to fight the galaxy alone! Avorion features co-op multiplayer, so team up with your friends to build stations together and destroy pirates and enemy factions! Work together to extend your influence in the galaxy and build your own empire. Or, you know, blow them apart in large PvP battles. It''s a sandbox, you can do whatever you want. In Avorion you choose your personal playstyle. Haul cargo, find profitable trading routes and found factories. Or maybe you''re sick of being the good guy? Build your own battleship, equip it with powerful weaponry and blow away your enemies. Be the aggressor that starts wars with entire factions, raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods and scavenge old wreckages. Find your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more hostile, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core.	;;	2007-09-05	;;	47.73	;;	163	;;	3

Volcanoids	;;	Craft legendary items, gear up your heroes for epic quests, and fight for the top of the Trade Wars and PvP Leaderboards in the original smash hit fantasy tycoon: Shop Heroes!	;;	About This Game  The Gods are gone â€“ their demise has left the world in turmoil. Dark forces the likes of which have never been seen before are amassing to tear the souls from those too weak to resist and devour whoever is left. Fling spells and swing metal, rush enemies and crush bones, and in the end, pry their weapons from their cold, unworthy hands. Carve a path through your enemies in your quest for glory in Pagan Online. An epic setting based on Slavic mythology â€“ the stuff of legends Set in a striking realm rich with lore and history, Pagan Online is based off various Slavic myths and sagas. Weâ€™ve drawn from this seemingly endless fount to create a distinct flavour and a whole new world for fans of epic fantasy to immerse themselves in. Tales of larger than life heroes, endangered deities, and shattered sanctity await you in Pagan Online. Itâ€™s dangerous to go alone Will you vanquish your foes lone wolf style, or team up with a friend to take on the biggest and baddest monsters? You can choose to play all levels alone or play game modes designed for more than one person. You can meet other players to fight alongside you in the Pantheon, a social hub for heroes approved by the Gods themselves. Crush without mercy At its core, Pagan Online is a game of dynamic and fast-paced action. You will experience gameplay that is responsive, fast, and satisfying â€“ and nothingâ€™s more satisfying than crushing, slicing, and smashing your way through hordes of enemies in a brutal and mesmerizing display of quick thinking and skill. It is easy to pick up but difficult to master â€“ a good thing to keep in mind after your 108th death. As you become more battle-hardened, your renown grows and doors open for you â€“ both to greater power and greater foes. A class for every player, a hero for every taste These arenâ€™t just your typical RPG classes! The playable characters in Pagan Online are inspired by old folksâ€™ tales and stories our grandmothers used to tell us when we were kids. From nomad knights to beastly abominations, they are familiar and yet like nothing youâ€™ve ever tried before. Every hero has their own abilities, playstyles, and their own weapons and attacks, so you could be forgiven for thinking youâ€™re playing a different game when you take up arms as another hero. Carry out devastating combos with skills in your repertoire and do whatever it takes to come out on top â€“ leech the blood of your downed foes to stay standing, summon the might of Perun himself in a thunderfist, or channel the elements to unleash raw destruction. Your hero, your style If youâ€™re going to be looking at your hero constantly, you might as well look at something nice. A hero is a hero no matter what they wear of course, but you gotta admit, the deep red of a blood spatter would look so fetching on your green robes. You can pick from a wide variety of class-specific armor sets for each hero. Not only can you upgrade and customize heroes to your liking, but you can also use unique skins and shaders so the enemy commanders will know exactly who is coming to end them. Wield weapons of legend Action RPGs canâ€™t work without loot. We all love it and your enemies love to drop it. Pagan Online takes it up a notch with a unique crafting system in which you can create a weapon tailor-made for you and how you prefer to play. Whether youâ€™re dead set on squeezing that extra speed percentage for fast flaying, or if you want to be a Jack-of-all-trades with more balanced stats, crafting in Pagan Online redefines the term â€˜legendary itemâ€™. 	;;	2011-08-26	;;	10.42	;;	568	;;	5

Pledge allegiance to one of the Nations and put your skills to the test in one of the best PvP system in the MMORPG universe!	;;	About This Software FaceRig is a program enabling anyone with a webcam to digitally embody awesome characters. It is meant to be an open creation platform so everybody can make their own characters, backgrounds or props and import them into FaceRig. (More on http://facerig.com ) FaceRig is being developed by Holotech Studios and the image-based face tracking SDK being used is provided by ULSee Inc. To find out more about ULSee Inc., visit http://ulsee.com or email them at info@ulsee.com . Our previous tracking technology was provided by Visage Technologies. FaceRig has three versions: FaceRig Classic is the base version of FaceRig, which allows for home non-profit use and even limited monetization on YouTube/Twitch or similar as long as the commercial aspect of it is not significant. We consider commercially significant using it on any avenue (channel) that produces you more than $500 monthly revenue. This includes ad-based revenue and voluntary donations (one time or recurrent such as a Patreon). If you are under this threshold you can use Classic, if you are above you need to upgrade to Pro or Studio. the FaceRig Pro DLC, which allows you to monetize videos on YouTube/Twitch regardless of the monthly revenue, but not for content exclusive to paid/subscription based services, such as the new YouTube Red (for content that is exclusive to YouTube Red or similar you will need FaceRig Studio). FaceRig Pro does not bring new assets, technical features or improvements to FaceRig Classic. For more details, take a look at the Pro DLC description the Studio Version allows commercial use, as well as  access to the expression mo-cap data. For more details about this version visit http://facerig.com We believe that FaceRig will entertain many gamers, modelling and animation artists, members of various fandoms, streamers, web casters, YouTubers and their audiences. For now we''re focusing on just tracking and rendering the portrait with its expressions, but we aim to do more in the future. The FaceRig end goal is to provide a full featured real time digital actor set for home use. Key Features: Real time head and expression tracking in an input video stream, (also with audio analysis). Combining tracked data with additional virtual puppeteering input. On-the-fly animation re-targeting for the tracked data and applying the animation on a user selected 3d model, with audio processing (voice alteration) Rendering and lighting the animated model in real time, in a user selected background. Encoding the rendered video and sending it further as output from a virtual webcam (it basically intercepts webcam input, and swaps the images captured by your real webcam with the fantastic content before sending it further). Provide the interface for tuning the parameters of all operations above. Customizable avatars. To see the complete list on FaceRig avatars including the ones from DLC''s please see: https://facerig.com/tips/tuesday-tips-0-avatar-list/ Open creation platform: you can make your own models (outside of FaceRig), import and use them as your avatars. The models need to be created according to  a set of published specs. Notes: Numeric export of the tracked expression data (exporting the motion capture data to use in other applications) is a feature reserved for the Studio version. FaceRig  Classic and Pro only output already rendered video and audio. FaceRig is an indie initiative, and its development so far has been successfully crowd-funded through Indiegogo.

Every night, everyone in town gets out of bed and sleepwalks. In the morning, they wake up with no recollection of what happened or where they were. IT TOOK YOUR FRIEND. THEY SAY IT''S NOT REAL Some teenagers in this town woke up during a few of these ''Blackouts'' themselves, finding themselves in the woods or on train tracks with no idea how they got there. When they tell their parents, their teachers, the police... no one believes them. Taking matters into their own hands, they formed a club - The Blackout Club - to get to the bottom of it. Unfortunately, the recent disappearance of a close friend means that the sleepwalking isn''t just strange - it could be deadly. IT WALKS AMONG THEM You and your friends must team up to overcome the powerful forces that are arrayed against you.

Sunless Skies is a Gothic Horror roleplay game with a focus on exploration and exquisite storytelling for PC, Mac and Linux.	;;	About This Game  In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition It''s been two years since This War of Mine global release and we''re still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same â€“ how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about?

Gamespot I was intrigued by This War of Mine''s attempts to portray the consequences of war in a way that games have largely ignored in the past. The fact that the psychological and emotional challenges of living under such horrifying conditions are something you have to consider as you struggle gives me added hope that it might treat its hefty and important subject matter with the gravity and complexity that it deserves.

As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare.	;;	About This Game War of Rights is a multiplayer game set during the perilous days of the American Civil War, in the Maryland Campaign of September, 1862. Campfire Games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period, while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of CRYENGINE. â €â €â €â €â €â € - Massive battles: Take part in engagements consisting of 150 players. - Tailored for line formation teamplay: Custom formation buff mechanic system rewards sticking together by lessening the suppression effects, the morale cost for the team when dying and the flag bearer respawn rate. - Historical accuracy: Period correct uniforms, weapons, manual of arms animations, battlefields, objectives & drill camps. - Regimental pride: 95 researched and recreated regiments all supporting uniforms for all ranks (Private to Colonel) and player classes. â €â €â €â €â €â € - Immersive communication: In-game 3D voice system. - Recreated battlefields: More than 30 historically accurate skirmish areas of the Battles of Antietam and South Mountain as well as the Siege of Harpers Ferry to play on and three drill camps to perfect your formation forming abilities or simply exchange battle stories at the campfire. - Player classes: Private, NCO, Flag Bearer & Officer playable from every regiment featured and covering all ranks from Private to Colonel. - Community focus: A strong company (player organized clans) focus with a dedicated company tool and forum sections devoted to in-game event creation. â €â €â €â €â €â € - Powerful game engine: Powered by CRYENGINE V, War of Rights is capable of providing visuals unmatched by any other Civil War game. - More than a game: War of Rights is a vision that keeps expanding its scale. The project is entirely crowdfunded and has been developed on for the past 6 years. We consider it more of an ever evolving artistic piece rather than a final product with a targeted release deadline with set features. Players in the game will be able to play on multiple battlefields of the campaign, from the confluence of the Potomac and Shedoah Rivers where the Siege of Harper''s Ferry took place, to the ridgelines of South Mountain, and to the meandering waters of Antietam Creek at the Battle of Antietam. Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. â €â €â €â €â €â € Uniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period. As a General, you will operate in your headquarters equipped with a map of the battlefield and constantly receiving reports of friendly and enemy positions. Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. â €â €â €â €â €â € Each map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, and rocks as they were in 1862 so players can fight through the streets of Harper''s Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox''s Gap at South Mountain, or in the cornfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds. Limbs will fly and blood will be spilt once again as Campfire Games brings the fighting of the Civil War right to the player''s computer screen! â €â €â €â €â €â € Will you heed the Union call against the traitors? Or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the Confederacy? You decide! â €â €â €â €â €â € We thought it a good idea to recreate/repost our Early Access roadmap as a lot of players having joined us recently are unlikely to know what we are intending to offer as the game advances in its development. The below roadmap should be taken for what it is - a preliminary list of things we have planned for. As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however. The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates. 1. Bug fixes, stability improvements: This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up. 2. Performance improvements: We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers. 3. Expanded server moderation tools: This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day. 4. End game events: Taken out just before the launch on Early Access, the end game events will be making a comeback in a more fleshed out form, specifically designed to create more memorable end game moments in cases where the question of who were the winners of the match is heavily contested. 5. Improved melee: Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (â€œkill-movesâ€) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting. 6. New battlefields: The Battles of South Mountain and Shepherdstown will eventually complete the Maryland Campaign of 1862. 7. Fleshed out officer order system: Additional officer commands will be introduced to allow for a greater range of tactical options. 8. Musicians: Working in tandem with the officer order system, musicians will have to relay the correct calls to help make sure the orders are received down the line. 9. Historical Battles mode: Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield. 10. Player controlled artillery: The many batteries already placed on the battlefields will become player controlled once we introduce an artillery system, where players will have access to some of the most destructive and tide-turning weapons of war. 11. Generals: The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war. 12. Cavalry: Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve''s debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ''Best PC Game Ever'' by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player''s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by SourceÂ®, Valve''s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ''muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source''s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy StoryÂ® and Monster''s, Inc.Â®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  	;;	2004-06-04	;;	41.99	;;	257	;;	3

You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, bugs and missing features. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend allowing some time before trying out the game. There are many YouTube game-plays showing the current state of game. I am the sole developer of the project, which I work  on in my spare time as a passion project.

A full detailed list of the updates since launch can be viewed here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/allnews/ . Goals of the project: The aim is to integrate the kinds of base-resource micro-management typically found in RTS titles, into a boots-on-the-ground shooter. Each base has an underlying economy of power and raw materials that must be maintained and expanded in order to rise in domice. The focus is not of primitive survival (although there are many elements during the early-game), but instead a focus on the base, its security, technology and resources.	;;	2017-03-20	;;	147.13	;;	363	;;	5

Metro:LastLightRedux	;;	Kagura Bundle bundle	;;	About This Game  STORY You just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won''t ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you''d like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc. MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn''t any truth to any of it. GAMEPLAY In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house.

Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth? Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game Explore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way! Donâ€™t expect to be â€œfedâ€ a pile of clues. Rather, take the role of a fly on the wall, observing and listening to the events as they unfold. Anyone could be the culprit; key clues may be revealed at any second; any character''s storyline may cross paths with another at any point in time. YOU be the editorâ€”the order of the story is up to you! â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  Tributes To: Detective Fiction: In Unheard, all the clues in a case will be presented to players. There''s no hidden information, nor rooms that require a key to enter. Players will be privy to the same information as everyone present at the crime scenes.  Immersive Theater: All characters in Unheard have their own storylines; however, each of these storylines will become interwoven in the same space, and at the same time, resulting in complicated cases that force you to meticulously search for and track clues. You can choose to follow one character or move around between multiple characters. You can also replay the audio as many times as you want until you reach a conclusion. Radio Drama: Unheard is, in a way, an interactive radio drama. By combining aural narrative techniques with the type of exploration elements present in video games, Unheard offers a brand-new, non-linear radio drama experience.

RecRoom	;;	Power & Revolution + 2019 Edition Bundle bundle	;;	About This Game  Administrator and monsters, you cannot possibly imagine. Lobotomy Corp is a Monster Management Rogue-Lite Simulation game. Our game was inspired by the monsters from game and movies such as SCP series, Cabin in the woods and Warehouse 13. Furthermore, it was developed from the thought of â€œWhat if those monsters were real and your job is to manage themâ€. You will be playing as an administrator of the company which is in the management of such creatures. These monsters generate a new energy source, and your job is to collect them through giving out to your subordinates. Through this process, you can open new departments that facility allows and encounter various monsters. In the game, the player will have to go through the companyâ€™s fear and tension filled the atmosphere. â€œOur new technology will bring salvation to the human race.â€ Lobotomy corporation is a newly established energy company that extracts an infinite amount of entropy through the isolation of abnormality with our self-developed technology. This is only an impression that the public has regarding our company. You will see its reality after you have joined us. Our facility is formed of many departments just like any other companies. You will have access to various departments as you gather more energy. The more you have access to various departments, the much easier the management of abnormality will become. Furthermore, an AI â€˜Angelaâ€™ and â€˜Sephiraâ€™ will be by your side to support your needs for the smooth process of work. An existence you constantly have to examine and observe. We have decided to call the monsters in Lobotomy as â€˜Abnormalityâ€™. You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while keeping the energy extraction level at its maximum. At first, you wonâ€™t have any information on Abnormality. You will only have your eyes and the manual to guide you. Speculate which process will be most suitable for each Abnormality. After that, just pick and place your employee who is best suited for the job and wait for results. Also, you will have to gather information through giving out orders to your employees to â€˜examineâ€™ the creature. You get the power to obtain information in the process of managing Abnormality. Abnormalityâ€™s energy generation level depends on their conditions This game is NOT a tycoon. As mentioned before, Abnormality is a creature that should be handled with an extreme alert. Some of them might donâ€™t like the idea of humans keeping them locked up in chambers. They will try to escape when they have a chance and when they do, they will destroy everything. Be it our employees or the facility. Furthermore, certain Abnormality can brainwash and corrupt our employees into their pawn. These â€˜pawnsâ€™ can have a bad effect on other employees and might randomly attack the people around them. Also, they also bring down the other employeesâ€™ mentality level which might result in disobedience. You could get rid them of course, but you should consider the fact that all the information and data regarding that employee will be deleted as well. One disaster will cause another, and it will lead everything into chaos. If you do not stop them instantly, the situation will get out of hand and fall into chaos. When this situation does occur, you will have to decide whether you will gather employees to recapture the Abnormality, or destroy some part of the facility with explosives to secure the companyâ€™s safety.  â€œDo you have any wishes, administrator?â€ Lobotomy corporation is divided into work procedure and the story mode. In work procedure, you will be doing your job as the companyâ€™s administrator managing the Abnormality and the energy generation level. A gameâ€™s story will follow right afterward. In Story mode, there is a dialogue with Sephira, including AI Angela, which will also appear in the work part. Through the mission they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden in the company. Furthermore, the player will be placed in a situation where they must answer or ask questions. You can also discover secrets surrounding the company and the player.	;;	2019-05-16	;;	169.39	;;	419	;;	1

You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself. Portals riddle the planar metropolis of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have the proper key.

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair. Modular stations and ship upgrades: Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship. Most dynamic X universe ever: X4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe. Managing your empire with a powerful map: Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions. Most detailed X economy ever: One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy. Research and Teleportation: The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you''ve unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders. Get into the game: In X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It''s all up to you to decide.	;;	2019-05-03	;;	88.72	;;	8	;;	2

We don''t guide you through a world on rails, and as a result, there are many hidden secrets awaiting discovery. Project: Gorgon also features an ambitious skill-based leveling system that bucks the current trend of pre-determined classes, allowing the player to combine skills in order to create a truly unique playing experience. AN IMMERSIVE WORLD When you play Project: Gorgon, we want you to feel as if youâ€™re immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than trying to manage this with just graphics and excessive backstory, weâ€™ve designed the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like youâ€™re really there interacting with the world, such as: Each non-player (NPC) you meet has their own goals and interest, and reward players that choose to be their friend. You can drop items on the ground, and other players can pick them up. Whatâ€™s so great about that? Imagine laying down a trail of literal (virtual) breadcrumbs to guide your friends (or lure your enemies) into the woods. Shopkeepers keep inventory, so you can buy items that other players have sold to them. Want to help out new players? Sell your cast-off items to the shopkeeper in the new player zone and watch the new players go to town. If you are on fire, you can jump into a lake to put it out. This type of mechanic can have a subtle effect on your strategies, especially when you are fighting a fire mage! You can inscribe messages onto items, write books, and even leave notes for other players. Make your name as an in-game poet, or pronounce your greatness to the world! UNIQUE EXPERIENCES In Project: Gorgon you kill monsters - a lot of them - and you take their loot. In order to keep the experience fun and interesting, weâ€™ve developed unique combat experiences to keep the fights feeling fresh. The loot is randomly generated, monsters have unique abilities, and dungeons have puzzles, traps, and terrifying bosses! The combat skills are entirely free-form. You can learn as many combat skills as you want, and use any two of them at the same time to create your own personal â€œclass.â€ Project: Gorgon features dozens to choose from, including: Battle Chemistry: Create huge explosions, inject yourself with mysterious mutagens or program a pet golem! Unarmed Combat: Grapple and control enemies using a situational-aware combo system that varies based on where you are and what day it is. Animal Handling: Tame animals and train them to become ferocious fighters. Then breed your best and sell their offspring to other players. Necromancy: Seek out corpses and graveyards to raise an undead army. No graveyard around? Well, there are always the corpses of your friends. Cow: Got turned into a cow by that boss? That sucks. But learn some kicks and how to stampede, and you''ll be right back out there kicking grass in no time! Thatâ€™s just a few! Thereâ€™s also Sword Fighting, Combat Psychology, Staff Fighting, Sigil Scripting, Mentalism, and more. Player Choices are important in Project: Gorgon. You can learn as many skills as you want, but sometimes power comes with downsides. You can become infected with lycanthropy and gain access to very powerful skill sets. As a lycanthrope, you are able to roam the world in a pack or as a lone wolf; however, when there is a full moon (which is tied to the real world lunar calendar) you are stuck in your beast form. Thereâ€™s no cure for lycanthropy. You can become a Druid - which will give you great power, but you have to vow to drop everything when thereâ€™s an emergency involving nature. It could be a forest fire, a monster invasion or even a pesky insect. Nature never lets you ignore your duties, ever. New opportunists come open, but others will be closed. Can you bear heavy burdens in exchange for greater power? JOIN THE COMMUNITY The community is a critical aspect of Project: Gorgon. We strive to maintain a strong, engaged community, supporting our players through: Live Events with a focus on story. Mechanisms For player-created quest content. Player housing (limited and instanced). Player-managed shops and vendor stalls. In-game communication tools like bulletin boards. Bookshelves where you can write and submit your own books and stories (and players can vote on their favorites). HELP DEFINE THE GAME During our beta (\"early access\") period, your feedback helps improve the game, from small things like bug-reports to large things like new skill suggestions, monster ideas, and more! We''ve already used hundreds of player-provided suggestions during our alpha period, and we''ll use even more suggestions during beta as we get into the down-and-dirty details of combat, crafting, and exploration.	;;	2020-09-15	;;	89.78	;;	530	;;	3
Half-Life	;;	Dead by Daylight: Halloween Edition bundle	;;	About This Game  Talisman Digital Edition - The Magical Quest Game for 1 to 6 players. The officially licensed multiplayer version of the classic fantasy adventure board game, Talisman. In Talisman Digital Edition, there are 14 characters a player can control, from the heroic Warrior to the powerful Sorceress. In this perilous adventure, players battle it out to journey across a dangerous land and be the first to claim the Crown of Command, a magical artefact with the power to destroy all rivals and make the bearer the true ruler of the kingdom. On your travels, you will need strength, courage and some good dice rolls to survive the dangers you face and beat your opponents to the centre of the board. Features - Multiplayer modes for up to 6 players. Play against AI opponents. 14 characters to choose from. 17 powerful spells to cast. Many expansions available. Detailed, interactive tutorial. Based on the Revised 4th Edition by Fantasy Flight Games. Frequently Asked Questions What is Talisman? Talisman is a board game in which you move around the board building up your characterâ€™s strength and magic power by battling monsters, finding treasures, completing quests and trying to be the first player to reach the centre space â€“ the Crown of Command. Can I play dirty? Thatâ€™s at the very core of Talisman! Cast spells at other players to make them miss turns! Steal from them! Turn them into toads! Send powerful allies to do your fighting for you! How replayable is the game? The emergent nature of the game means that every game will tell its own tale. The board starts with just the playing pieces and builds up to become a land filled with terrible danger and fabulous treasure! As you move around the board, you must make careful decisions about where to travel as each space can become more dangerous or more helpful as the game progresses. To help you get around, players can use things like teleporting, magic portals and fate, which allows you to re-roll your dice to get different results. How long is a game of Talisman? The physical board game can take 2-5 hours with 6 players, but our digital version cuts that down drastically, with an offline 6 player game typically taking no more than 1 hour. Offline and online games can be saved and resumed at any time so your adventures can take as long as you like! Weâ€™ve also added some features which decrease the length of games â€“ House rules and Runestone cards. House rules change the basic rules slightly to speed-up the game and Runestone cards, exclusive to this digital edition, give characters extra abilities and allow them to become very powerful much quicker, making for shorter games. Is there a hotseat mode? Yes! Look your opponents in the eyes as you face them in deadly combat or sneak up from the shadows and steal their favourite items! All of the fun and social enjoyment of the physical game is captured in the digital version, but with no setup time! Whatâ€™s included with the base game and are there expansions? For the initial purchase, everything that you get with the physical board game is included â€“ all of the characters, spells and adventure cards, plus a few bonuses we''ve added. Many expansions are available now. These add lots more spells, events, monsters, characters and alternative endings! Extra characters are also available to purchase, including rare characters from Talismanâ€™s history. Talisman Â© Games Workshop Limited 1983, 1985, 1994, 2007.

Two years after Commander Shepard repelled invading Reapers bent on the destruction of organic life, a mysterious new enemy has emerged. On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced.

Here''s a little Imgur post we put together to document our journey. https://imgur.com/gallery/th21G Since its launch, Sairento VR has been gaining fans worldwide with its unique locomotion system. It is the one game in VR that allows you to experience the iconic ''bullet-time'' scenes from The Matrix, blended with the slow-motion mayhem of the Max Payne game series, all while looking and feeling as badass as the Bride from Kill Bill.  In Sairento VR, you play a cyber ninja. Perform triple jumps, wall runs, power slides, back flips and slow down time while blasting away at a foe before landing to deliver a lethal strike on another. Kit yourself with your weapons of choice - katanas, firearms, bows, throwing glaives - they are all at your disposal.  Popular gamers like Node call it their â€˜favourite VR gameâ€™ and Nathie, Cix Liv, JoshDub, TimDotTV and more all give it a thumbs up. Sairento VR was designed to be easy to pick up, but tough to master. The more time you spend with Sairento VR, the better you will perform the moves in the game and the more you will be rewarded with the unparalleled feeling of being the action hero of a big budget move production. - GET TRANSFORMED INTO A DEADLY CYBER NINJA - Sairento VR is a mission-driven, VR action role-playing game set in a re imagined Japan in the near future. In Sairento, you play as a member of the Silent Ones - a righteous but covert organization of seemingly ordinary people who practice the long forsaken code and martial arts of the ancient samurais and ninjas.

SecretWorldLegends	;;	Final Assault is a WWII themed Action Strategy Game that capitalizes on the full power of Virtual Reality. Command massive ground battles as the skies erupt in dynamic dog fights and bombing runs. Combat requires quick thinking and fast reflexes. Fight the battle, win the war!	;;	About This Game Scream over the runways of super-hardened Iraqi airbases as your squadron sprinkles bomblets on the pavement or blows up aircraft shelters using laser-guided bombs. Turn back the Russian tide in the Ukraine. Ride the Mediterranean waves in fast Israeli attack craft, trading barrages of anti-ship missiles with Syrian ships. Stand toe-to-toe against Iran in the Persian Gulf. Wrestle the Falklands under your control. Go â€œDown Townâ€ around Hanoi and spar with the deadly NV air defences. Hunt down rogue nukes in Pakistan before they fall into terrorist hands. Face off with your carrier group against India or China â€“ from either side. Square off against the Soviet Union in the cold war confrontation, and against resurgent Russia in the new multipolar world order. Lead nuclear-powered sharks of steel against the masters of antisubmarine ops. Exchange volleys of fire in close-quarters gun duels, or obliterate the enemy with sophisticated, heavy-hitting hypersonic missiles from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Survive massive, vicious air battles. Escort vital convoys to their destination, or make a last stand against all odds. When things escalate out of control, step up to unconventional or even nuclear weapons. Play the most dangerous game of hide and seek â€“ at sea, on land and in the air - even in near-space. Command is the next generation of air/naval wargaming. YOU ARE IN CONTROL Surface fleets, submarine squadrons, air wings, land-based batteries and even satellite constellations are yours to direct as you see fit â€“ from the lowliest pirate skiff to the mightiest aircraft carrier, from propeller biplanes to supersonic stealth fighters, and from WW2-era iron bombs, torpedoes & mines and the trusty ''Mk1 Eyeball'' to ultra-modern radars with imaging capability, multi-spectral recon satellites, ''brilliant'' self-guided stand-off weapons, 200-knot supercavitating torpedoes and hypersonic anti-ship ballistic missiles. Every sensor and weapon system is modeled in meticulous detail. You are given the hardware; but you have to use it well. THE WORLD AT YOUR FINGERTIPS Throw your distorted flat maps away â€“ Command uses a realistic 3D earth globe for each of its scenarios. Rotate and zoom in and out of the action, from satellite view down to the trenches and wavetops. Play scenarios or build your own on any place on earth â€“ from classics like the Middle East, South Atlantic, North Cape and Europe to new and rising hotspots like the Arctic, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Use a powerful yet intuitive point-and-click mouse interface for controlling your forces and go advanced with a wide collection of hotkeys for quickly jumping around the action and issuing complex orders in the heat of the battle. RELENTLESS REALISM Sensors and weapons work just like in real life, with all their strengths and weaknesses. Units move, detect, fight and win or die based on what their systems can and cannot do. Electronic warfare and technological levels can tilt the balance of battle. The weather can be your best ally and your worst enemy. The terrain, both overland and undersea, can hide you from the enemy but also can block your weapons from firing. Your aircraft can choose different mission profiles and loadouts, each with its advantages and limitations, and can dash high (speed, range) or scream low (protection). Thermal layers, convergence zones, surface ducting, the deep sound channel and factors such as water temperature and terrain slope may decide the sub vs ship duel. Thick clouds or rain can render your fancy laser-guided bombs useless. Stealth may help you avoid detection, or a jamming barrage may tip the scales when you are out of options. Commandâ€™s battle environment is as unforgiving as the real thing â€“ and as rewarding for those who understand and use it. THE MEN AT THE CONTROLS Your war machines are (almost always) not robots; they are crewed by humans. People trained with varied proficiency (from novice to ace), operating under custom doctrine and rules of engagement (when to do what, how to decide, how to react etc.), most of the time making the rational decision, and sometimes making a brilliant call or a mistake. These people often matter far more than the hardware. The very same surface-to-air missile battery that is a worthless toy when staffed by Iraqi or Libyan crews turns to a deadly weapon even against ultra-modern aircraft under the expert hand of Egyptian, Serbian or Russian operators. The deadliest combat units are only as sharp as their crews. AIR/NAVAL WARFARE AROUND THE WORLD Korea. Colonial wars. Vietnam. Middle East. Cuba. Falklands. Iran-Iraq. World War 3. Desert Storm. India & Pakistan. The Arctic circle. Past and future conflicts in the Pacific, Norwegian Sea, Russian periphery and more. Experience conflict from post-WW2 all the way to 2020+ and beyond. Test your mettle against lethal land-based missile batteries, air regiments, naval fleets or pirate groups. Face off against threats of the past, present and future. How do you measure up against the challenges of modern warfare? LEAD, DONâ€™T MICROMANAGE Realistic modern combat with all its technicalities scaring you away? Your staff & tactical AI sweat the details so you donâ€™t have to. Airbase crews shuffle aircraft around on land facilities to prepare them for the next mission. Aircraft position themselves to deliver their payloads optimally, and refuel on their own if they have to; Ships and subs maneuver on their own to reach out and touch the enemy (including winding their way around islands, landmasses and even known mines) â€“ and everyone tries very hard to save his skin when bullets are flying. Manage the big decisions and let your virtual crews get to the details â€“ and still intervene whenever you want. MAKE YOUR OWN WAR Think you can build a better conflict? Prove it! Commandâ€™s integrated scenario editor offers unparalleled functionality for making your own scenarios or editing existing ones. Create and share with other players detailed, exact-down-to-the-meter land installations from all over the world â€“ from airbases to port complexes to ICBM fields. Customize unit icons, sound effects, even platform weapons and sensors (Aegis on the USS Iowa â€“ click and done). Create multiple sides with variable, complex alliances and postures and different proficiency ratings. Assign forces to detailed missions with custom behaviors and inheritable doctrines. Script complex interactive events with the advanced event editor. Assign variable success thresholds â€“ from triumph to utter defeat. From a gunboat duel all the way to global thermonuclear warfare â€“ the possibilities are endless. HUNDREDS OF SCENARIOS Command MANO includes 42 scenarios (3 tutorials) and hundreds of community scenarios available FEATURES Powerful, detailed 3D-globe (Google Earth-style) with multiple map layers Intuitive, point-and-click user interface for beginners backed up by a vast array of hotkeys for power users Aircraft, surface ships, submarines, land units, strategic & space forces and all their real-life sensors, weapons and other systems are at your disposal Extensive, detailed simulation databases modeling faithfully the capabilities & limitations of each unit More then 40 included scenarios covering multiple historic and hypothetical conflicts.

In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character''s special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online! Featuring Up to 4 players:  Play locally AND online with up to 4 players. Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay:  Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. Tons of unlockable extras and secrets:  Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. Play on your own:  Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City. Modes and options: Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... Wicked Tracks:  A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen. Lethal League Blaze is the sequel to the popular projectile-fighting game Lethal League known for it''s ridiculous speeds and hitstun, the original game was intense to watch and intenser to play. This time around there will be double the characters at launch and more to come after.	;;	1999-03-27	;;	181.88	;;	532	;;	5

Engage in desperate car chases, diagnose life-threatening injuries, and put out lethal fires! Each department has its own vehicles and equipment for you to operate while on duty. Play in single player, or work together with friends in online multiplayer to tackle incidents across a shared world. Usually the first to respond to a criminal incident, the police are equipped with the fastest vehicle and a variety of equipment. Their roles vary from handing out parking tickets to chasing down dangerous suspects. Theyâ€™ll do everything they can to prevent criminal activity and put a stop to any crimes in progress. As an emergency medical specialist, your job lies in keeping members of the public alive, treating patientsâ€™ injuries, diagnosis and more. Lifesaving equipment youâ€™ll utilise includes medical kits, stretchers and ambulances. The role of the fire department extends far beyond putting out flames, as they work closely with medical services out in the field, swiftly cutting open crashed cars so that medical staff can reach the casualty. The fire department wonâ€™t engage in the pursuit of suspects, but will handle the aftermath of an incident, including, of course, putting out fires. Battling raging flames and freeing trapped civilians involves some heavy-duty gear including spreaders, a fire hose, a fire extinguisher and a fire truck. MULTI-PLAYER Team up with fellow players online and divide your team between the three emergency services at will. Race around the open world in various vehicles, to where you are needed, working together to help civilians in accidents or catch a fleeing criminal.

To quote Jazzuo himself: ''The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well\".

Fight for FURvival: Super Animal Royale is an intense, strategic, top-down 2D twist on the battle royale genre.

It allows you to play the game fully online, as much as you like! And you can even start progressing through the game, earning items and animal DNA. These cosmetic items you earn in the Super Free Edition are locked, so you won''t be able to create new Super Animals or dress them up to make them your own, but if you like the game and choose to purchase it, all of your items and progress you''ve earned will transfer right into the full game!

Your super animal can be customized with new outfits, tombstones, death explosions, weapons, dance moves, and more, so you can look your best as you do your worst.

Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play â€“one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources. Increasing difficulty. As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work. RESOURCES & INDUSTRY There are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them. Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses. WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDS Every worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time â€“ cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc. Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements. TRANSPORTATION You have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don''t forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time. ECONOMY SIMULATION  The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction. You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper. As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.	;;	2012-12-25	;;	140.82	;;	722	;;	5

Keep an eye out for those lovely rainy days, where you can spend your time doing other tasks without worrying about your crops withering away. There is water everywhere! So it''s no surprise that the villagers on these islands like to fish. Whether it''s dawn or dusk there is a large variety of fish to catch.

HelloNeighbor	;;	Experience the Next Generation of the #1 Fighting Franchise. Mortal Kombat X combines unparalleled, cinematic presentation with all new gameplay.	;;	About This Game In this city-building strategy game, you control a group of exiled travelers who decide to restart their lives in a new land. They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland.  The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enoughâ€”there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.  Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeopleâ€™s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.  There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.  The success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.	;;	2012-10-09	;;	196.76	;;	601	;;	2

Experience the bloodiest period of U.S. history - the American Civil War of 1861-1865. MAIN FEATURES Full campaign: Fight in the American Civil War campaign and participate in 50+ battles from small engagements to massive battles that can last several days over hundreds of square miles of terrain. Campaign fully depends on player actions and battle results. Historical battles can also be played separately. The game includes the following battles in the campaign: Battle of Aquia Creek Battle of Philippi 1st Battle of Bull Run Battle of Shiloh Battle of Gaines'' Mill Battle of Malvern Hill 2nd Battle of Bull Run Battle of Antietam Battle of Fredericksburg Battle of Stones River Battle of Chancellorsville Battle of Gettysburg Battle of Chickamauga Battle of Cold Harbor Battle of Richmond Battle of Washington + 48 smaller scale battles Army management: You are the general. You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans. Lose a lot of your soldiers and you might not have enough reinforcements to deliver victories. Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign. Innovative command system: You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions. Or design a deep flanking maneuver by just drawing an arrow and send the whole army to the enemy flank or the rear. Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although ''no plan survives contact with the enemy\". Officer progression: Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player. The Officers rank up based on their unitsâ€™ performance, but it''s war and they can be wounded or even get killed in action. New ranks open new possibilities and allow officers to lead bigger units without efficiency loss. Winning battles also opens new possibilities for you as a general, increasing skills such as reconnaissance or political influence. Historical weapons: There is huge variety of Civil War weaponry from mass produced Enfield pattern rifles to rare Whitworths. Historical availability has also been implemented. Certain weapons can only be captured by raiding supplies or taken from the enemy on the battlefield. Enhanced unit control: Detach skirmishers to send them to scout those hills ahead. Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if itâ€™s needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early. Advanced Artificial Intelligence: You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. Terrain matters: Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields â€“ everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. Beautiful maps: We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes. Hardcore, deep war games can be beautiful. In our game, every historical battle landscape is accurately hand-drawn, utilizing data from satellite and historical maps. The topography plays immense strategic role and helps to understand how battles were fought and to learn history.	;;	2013-07-31	;;	114.61	;;	36	;;	1

Create a custom character and choose from several different classes to delve deep into the mysteries of what evil lurks below. Dig down and explore the randomly generated levels, find random items, and combat deadly monsters to get the answers. Though this game looks similar to other games in the genre, it plays very differently. It is a true RPG, with many stats and character classes. It is very reminiscent of other games made by David Brevik such as Diablo, Diablo II, Hellgate: London and Marvel Heroes. With eight character classes to choose from, randomly generated levels, random stats on items, secret areas, bosses, a survival talent tree and three different play modes, it delivers a very different and unique gaming experience. Are you ready to find out what Lurks Below? CREATE YOUR CHARACTER Bard (melee) - Wield the power of song and screaming to best your foes in battle. With trusty sword and shield and specializing in passive area effect damage and buffs, the bard is a force of nature in the battle field. â €â € Cleric (melee + ranged) - Come prepared for battle with heavy armor and plenty of healing power. Choose to fight with a mace and shield or a ranged wand. The cleric is the only class who is given this choice. Paired with its high survive-ability, it is the class that will outlive all others. â €â € Enchanter (ranged) - Stun and lightning are the enchanters tools of choice. What better way to avoid damage than stopping enemies in their tracks. If that wasn''t enough, the enchanter can wield the power of illusion and turn into a wisp and fly away. â €â € Necromancer (ranged) - Wielding the skulls of the dead as undead minions, marks the necromancer as the games resident pet class. Pair this with powerful poison and cold damage and self buffs, means the necromancer is an undead friendly powerhouse. â €â € Paladin (melee) - Dashing into combat wielding a powerful two handed sword or hammer makes the paladin one of the most formidable melee characters in the game. Consecrating the ground, area effect purification and damage are just a few of the tools this powerful holy warrior brings to the table. â €â € Rogue (melee) - Slip past enemies by hiding in the shadows and then when the moment is right, stab them with the rogue''s powerful dual wielding daggers. â €â € Warrior (melee) - Decide between defensive stance and offensive stance; both make the warrior an incredible beast in battle. While defensive stance focuses on survive-ability and offensive stance focuses on damage, both are incredibly satisfying, especially combined with the warriors whirlwind ability. â €â € Wizard (ranged) - Harnessing the power of the elements through powerful area affect spells make the wizard an unstoppable elemental force. Their spell set is rounded out with a drake companion and teleport. â €â €â € CHOOSE YOUR GAME STYLE â €â € Creative - Enjoy all the game has to offer in more relaxed setting. No need to worry about survival mechanics, though still have the benefit of the survival tree. Many of the recipes and building supplies are already unlocked, which makes it much easier to languish in the joy of building and farming the whole surface. With no invasions to worry about, the only monsters that will be encountered are below in the dungeon. Descent - Same difficulty as Survival, just without the survival aspect. For anyone interested in just thrashing monsters and getting all the loot. No survival tree, no hunger, and no fatigue. Survival - This is the original game design mode. Not that this makes the other modes any less valid, but most of the game is designed with Survival Mode in mind. This includes all the bells and whistles of surviving and the survival tree, paired with difficult dungeon challenges and plenty of invasions. Hardcore - Both Survival and Descent have a hardcore option. This doesn''t change anything about the particular mode other than you get only one death. Choose what works best for you! There are no wrong choices! FEW LAST TIPS! Surviving is rough out here (unless you are playing Descent, in which case, learn to make potions!). Make sure to grab all the food you can find, cook your vegetable, chop down trees, dig up ore, craft some new armor, and start your farm. â €â € One last thing that will help with survival, inventory space and your characters fabulous look is to build up your town. Many new buildings will become unlocked as you travel further into the dungeon; don''t forget to build them. And  while you are at it, you might as well craft yourself some new armor as well. Oh and maybe a ring...and some potions. â €â € Now you are truly ready! We hope you enjoy the game as much as we did creating it! 	;;	2005-11-30	;;	68.04	;;	120	;;	1

Features include a deep skill based combat system, complex and smart AI, fully interactive environments, an advanced damage model with accurate collisions and locational protection, roguelike elements and an arena mode to hone your combat skills. ''Those who would enter the underworld shall not only forfeit their lives... ...but bring oblivion to all mankind.\" WARNING: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT! This game features a very deep, truly physics based combat system. This is not just some animation feature, it is a fundamental difference that is central to gameplay. Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of your inputs is crucial to the outcome. This will likely be unlike anything you''ve played before and may take some practice, but can be hugely rewarding and the skill cap is virtually infinite. It is not particularly fast paced or difficult but it does require you to pay attention, it is very tactical and just casually pressing buttons won''t get you very far! Our goal is to create a deep and immersive RPG world based on a more advanced simulation supporting an unprecedented level of dynamic and emergent gameplay. All of the technology we use including the game engine is our own, developed from the ground up to realise this vision. Exanima is born as a prelude to Sui Generis (SG), our ambitious open world RPG that has been in development for over two years following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Exanima is a smaller yet complete game in its own right, a dungeon crawler that takes place in SG''s Underworld some twenty years prior to its events. Both games are being developed in concert, many of SG''s more ambitious features will make an appearance in Exanima as development continues. Exanima provides a reasonably complete and meaningful game experience, but many more features are on their way! We have met our most challenging and significant development goals, now we are ready to bring new features to light and make an even more fun and compelling adventure. Here are some of the planned features, with many already being close to completion: Per session and global character skill progression Large non-linear main game following early content Build and permanently save characters by completing early content New encounters, items and environments Ranged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres Numerous moddable thaumaturgic powers More complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas Complex NPC interactions and dialogue Cooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer 	;;	2016-07-15	;;	127.04	;;	665	;;	2

There are many game modes available in TerraTech to stretch your Tech building imagination to the limits! Story In the distant future, Earth''s natural resources have been depleted, and as a resource-gathering prospector it''s your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. But you are not alone! Rival prospectors litter the landscapes of these new worlds, and will fight to protect whatâ€™s theirs, and invade to take whatâ€™s yours. To make your mark, you will need to be cunning and creative. Using the building blocks, guns, wheels, and wings from several Mining Corporations, you can build varied Techs to suit every purpose. Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success. The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses. The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them whoâ€™s boss! By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains. All exo-planetary miners buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, which each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp or act with miltary efficiency utilizing the stealth focussed Hawkeye. New Corporations weâ€™re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, technological superiority giants Better Future and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION.

Co Unconquered is a survival RTS set in the barbaric world of Co the Barbarian where you must build your stronghold and assemble an unconquerable army to survive the savage hordes of Hyboria. Wave after wave of increasingly more difficult enemies will rush at your gates and you will need to manage resources, research new technologies to advance your defenses, and recruit an ever-growing army if you are to save survive utter destruction. You can choose to play the game entirely alone in single-player, but Co Unconquered can also be enjoyed in full two-player co-op allowing for a truly unique, shared multiplayer experience. Players share a base where both can freely construct new buildings and amass an army to reach their common goal. The enemy hordes will keep coming at you and how long you can resist the invasion depends entirely on your ability to build your stronghold and lead your army. Gameplay is real-time, but you can also pause at any time to issue commands and start construction of new buildings. Battles will be bloody and savage with players having to deal with anything from fires raging through their stronghold to piles of corpses spreading death and disease. The savage horde is at your gates. Will you fall or will you remain unconquered? STAND AGAINST THE HORDE Battle wave after wave of increasingly more difficult enemies coming to destroy your stronghold, from lowly footmen to experienced elites and mighty siege weapons. Giant snakes and scorpions, spearmen, necromancers, and flying demons will arrive in vast numbers to see your home burn to the ground. BUILD AN UNCONQUERABLE STRONGHOLD Manage resources such as food, gold, wood, and iron to fuel your expanding stronghold. Construct a variety of different buildings from housing to temples and military barracks. Build defensive walls around your stronghold and equip them with traps such as oil cauldrons to keep attackers at bay. TWO-PLAYER CO-OP MULTIPLAYER Play together online and build a shared stronghold while fending off the enemy hordes. Both players can build structures freely, and research upgrades, walls, and structures are all shared allowing for a truly unique and cooperative multiplayer experience.  You can also try the game in challenge mode, where you can play the same maps as other players and see how well you compare to them. CONTROL LEGENDARY HEROES Heroes are incredibly powerful units that can greatly influence the outcome of battles. These heroes, including Co himself, possess special abilities and you can equip them with unique artifacts that you find as you explore the world. ASSEMBLE AN UNCONQUERABLE ARMY You may start out with only a few foot soldiers, but before long you will have amassed an epic army of heavy cavalry, sorcerers, and more, ready at your command. Train units and keep them fed and paid to see their power grow and become truly unconquerable. SURVIVE DISEASE, FIRE, AND DEATH The world of Co the Barbarian is one of blood, battle, and savagery. As your soldiers and those of your enemy die on the battlefield, their bodies will be left to rot and spread disease that can quickly turn the tide of war. Of course, a necromancer might be able to turn that to their advantage. EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENT Randomly generated maps allow for infinite re-playability and each map holds vast opportunities for players that dare to explore beyond their stronghold. Discover ruins hiding great treasures, but beware: these are often protected by massive guardians that you need to bring down to claim your loot. CALL UPON THE GODS Build a temple and dedicate your stronghold to Mitra. Summon their massive avatar that towers above the battlefield and crushes your enemies in its footsteps. BLACK COLOSSUS COMIC Play the game to unlock more and more of the Black Colossus Co comic. Itâ€™s an original Co story and forms the foundation for the setting in the game.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots'' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you''re allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn''t right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren''t in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy''s? ''For all the simplicity of the gameâ€™s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddyâ€˜s is frightening. Itâ€™s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. Itâ€™s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\"  -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com  This game was created using Clickteam Fusion!	;;	2005-05-21	;;	155.09	;;	745	;;	3

DCUniverseOnline	;;	V-RACER HOVERBIKE is a fast-paced futuristic racing game in VR (HTC VIVE, OCULUS RIFT and Windows Mixed Reality).	;;	About This Game  The Next Installment to the Award-Winning RTS. While many were hopeful that diplomacy would finally end the war, differing opinions on what should be done, along with the depleted power of the controlling factions, has led to a splintering of the groups involved. The loyalist members of the Trader Emergency Coalition adopt a policy of isolation, focusing on enhanced defenses to ride out the rest of the war. Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos. For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unityâ€™s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny. The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy. Take the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion â€“ a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls ''the pinnacle of an entire genre\". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - â€œDo Not Go Gentleâ€ Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - â€œLumice Fugueâ€ Mackenzieâ€™s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining three episodes of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access. Keep in mind that your purchase of The Long Dark entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE, as well as updates to Survival Mode along the way.

You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.

PixARK	;;	Rise of Nations is back! Play the updated classic with full Steamworks integration and enhanced features!	;;	About This Game  MechWarrior Onlineâ„¢ Solaris 7 MechWarrior Onlineâ„¢ Solaris 7 is a tactical, ''Mech-based online shooter set in the vast BattleTech Universe. In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players. Enter the Solaris Arena. The newest addition to MechWarrior onlineâ„¢, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mechâ€™s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat. Quick Play is where you''ll find fast action, fielding a single ''Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory. In Faction Play you will field 4 â€˜Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction''s territory across the Inner Sphere. Gameplay Piloting a ''Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, ''Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion. Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and ''Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a ''Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a ''Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can''t handle the stress. Fight Smart - ''Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a ''quick kill\'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable ''Mechs and components. Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a ''Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces. Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault â€˜Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect ''Mech - Hundreds of unique ''Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller ''Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger ''Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different ''Mechs to find those that best suit your play style. Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power. Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new ''Mechs and equipment. Certain items can only be purchased using premium ''Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events. ''Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the ''Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems. MechWarrior Onlineâ„¢ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.	;;	2008-10-17	;;	2.46	;;	623	;;	4

Your main foe is the plague itself, an incorporeal and malevolent entity that you have to defeatâ€¦ without having the means to. Itâ€™s more powerful and more treacherous than you can imagine. Loot, murder, mug, steal, barter, begâ€¦ or donâ€™t. You need resources to survive, and itâ€™s up to you how to obtain them. The fights are short, ungraceful, and vicious. Theyâ€™re not always lethal though. Many peopleâ€”yourself includedâ€”would prefer to exchange their wallet for their life. 	;;	2008-03-11	;;	190.67	;;	486	;;	4

WastelandSurvival	;;	This ''spaceship simulation roguelike-like'' allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.	;;	About This Game  Post Scriptum is a WW2 simulation game, focusing on historical accuracy, large scale battle, difficult learning curve and an intense need for cohesion, communication and teamwork. Players will relive the events of â€˜Operation Market Gardenâ€™ across the fields and towns of Holland. This massive Allied assault consisted of a coordination of the British and American Airborne to capture key bridges while the British XXX Corps moved to reinforce them through Highway 69. However, consecutive delays in consolidating ground from the north of Belgium through Nijmegen forced the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem to make a stand much longer than anticipated. With no successful link between the XXX Corps and the Airborne in sight, the seventh and final bridge in Arnhem was considered lost. â€˜The Bloody Seventhâ€™ is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the lower Rhine. Players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division, British XXX Corps, 82nd US Airborne, 101st US Airborne or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. Itâ€™s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was Operation Market Garden, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas. Each area is being accurately recreated from archival references that range from street level to aerial images. Whether youâ€™re jumping out of a plane, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank you will find multiple reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment.	;;	2003-02-21	;;	167.65	;;	477	;;	5

You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew''s morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts. Kriegsmarine career During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat''s skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy''s technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies. Accurate simulation Game''s simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship''s trim (tilt) or Earth''s curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it''s better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands! 	;;	2007-06-21	;;	33.54	;;	390	;;	5

RawData	;;	Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is the full and complete edition of Shovel Knight, a sweeping classic action adventure game series with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic.	;;	About This Game  â€œBy blending real-time stealth with tried-and-true tactics gameplay, Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden breaks exciting new ground for the turn-based strategy game.â€ - IGN From a team including former designers of HITMAN and PAYDAY comes Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, a tactical game that combines the turn-based combat of XCOM with real-time stealth and exploration of a post-human world reclaimed by natureâ€¦ and Mutants. Of course the world ends. It was just a question of time. Extreme climate change, global economic crisis, a lethal pandemic, and increasing tension between old and new superpowers. For the first time since 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict. Mushroom clouds rose from east to west before the dust settled. Now itâ€™s over and the Earth is still. Nature has invaded ruined cities. Wind sweeps through empty streets, turned into graveyards. The humans are all gone. Scavenging through the remains of civilization are the Mutants, deformed humanoids and animals alike, searching for salvation or just something to eat. To survive, you and your companions must venture out to explore the Zone. Maybe one day you will find the Eden of legends, the ancientsâ€™ haven in the middle of hell. Thatâ€™s where truth awaits, the stories say. Maybe you will find your answers there. Then again, maybe itâ€™s all bullshit. TACTICAL COMBAT Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is the ultimate fix for your tactical strategy addiction. Dive into a deep, turn-based, tactical combat system inspired by the XCOM games. EXPLORE A POST-HUMAN EARTH  Journey through a post-human world of abandoned cities, crumbling highways, and overgrown countryside. Check back at the Ark, a neon-bathed oasis of ill repute and questionable characters, to restock your supplies and plan out your next adventure. CONTROL A TEAM OF MUTANTS A duck with an attitude problem and a boar with anger issues; these arenâ€™t your typical heroes. Get to know Dux, Bormin, Selma, and many other characters each with their own unique personality and deranged perspective on the world and their situation. MASTER THE STEALTHY APPROACH Sneak through shadows to avoid conflict or to catch enemies unaware. Real-time stealth allows you full control of approach: sneak into an enemy camp, position the team of Mutants to your advantage, and gain the element of surprise. UNLOCK MUTATIONS Unlock new mutations and abilities for your Mutants, such as Selmaâ€™s grasping vines, Borminâ€™s Charge, and Duxâ€˜ uncanny ability to sneak into a camp full of enemies unnoticed, despite being a 4-foot tall walking, talking duck with a crossbow. DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT Use the environment to your advantage. Stay out of floodlights, hide from line of sight, or just blast down fully destructible walls and buildings and wreak utter havoc. LOOT, LOOT EVERYWHERE From makeshift slingshots to high-powered rifles and top hats to police vests, make sure you equip your Mutants for the dangers ahead. Nothing says post-human quite like a mutated boar in spiked metal armor charging at you with a blunderbuss in his hands.	;;	2017-04-09	;;	164.64	;;	199	;;	5

Not at this time. We are planning on integrating one in the future, however we want to make sure most of the ship systems are finalized before building it. If you want to learn about how to play and use the various ship systems, you can click here to view the manual! Can I stream and/or monetize game footage? Yes! This is our written permission to do so. Simulation or Game? We like using the term simulation because it helps convey the fact that each starship is a large collection of systems and mechanics working together and reacting to its environment. However, this is a game first and foremost. Because of that, we aren''t afraid to go outside the realms of reality if it makes the experience more enjoyable. This is not a 100% realistic simulation, it''s a game with simulated elements. Player versus player modes? PULSAR was designed from the ground up to be cooperative in nature. None of the mechanics are prepared to handle the specific challenges of PvP combat. We believe that this focus on pure cooperation will enable us to create an experience that is unique and feasible by our small team. Singleplayer? We are focusing on a multiplayer experience at this time. We do offer AI crew bots that can take over unfilled roles, but they are very much a work in progress. The game is very teamwork heavy so the recommended experience is with multiple people. If you looking for a more complete singleplayer experience, you may want to consider waiting until the AI is fully developed. Where can I get more information? For more information, check out these links below: Classes Factions Roadmap Manual Forums The game is currently under development. New systems and mechanics are still being added and tweaked, and there is not a large amount of in-game content to see yet. If you prefer to play more complete games and have no desire to be part of the testing / feedback process of a game in development, we highly recommend waiting until the game is more complete before considering a purchase. 	;;	1999-11-09	;;	193.14	;;	453	;;	4

You wake up in unknown surroundings to the sound of the Game Masterâ€™s unfamiliar voice. Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Masterâ€™s deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one. When playing as an innocent, youâ€™ll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side theyâ€™re likely to be on. A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting bloody and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. Youâ€™ll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form youâ€™re faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations youâ€™ll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay!

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no manâ€™s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isnâ€™t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man''s land in search of the enemy. 	;;	2013-05-06	;;	122.28	;;	406	;;	5

A simple iconic-based view of your countries issues allows you to ''drill-down'' through all the relationships between policies and voters to quickly analyze the impacts of your decisions. Your trade policy may affect GDP, which will affect unemployment, which will effect poverty, and thus crime, leading to a change in tourism, which affects GDP... Complex simulated voters Each individual voter is a mixture of a subset of the 21 different voter groups represented within the game. They might be a young, wealthy, liberal socialist commuter, or a retired conservative religious capitalist, for example.

MutantYearZero:RoadtoEden	;;	A tactical game combining the turn-based combat of XCOM with story, exploration, stealth, and strategy. Take control of a team of Mutants navigating a post-human Earth. Created by a team including former HITMAN leads and the designer of PAYDAY.	;;	About This Game  It''s an oldschool/boomercore game not by just looks and engine, but by gameplay. That means: âž£ Sprawling levels that offer a degree of freedom and don''t hold the player''s hand. Exploring, hunting secrets, backtracking, patience and having to figure out what to do next is key. Monsters and pickups are hand-placed and vary according to the difficulty you play on. âž£ Original story packed with lots of lore and doubled by a permeating atmosphere. Intensive attention to detail and world building. âž£ Gory, fast paced shooting, a solid arsenal of weapons and magic items. Combat is projectile-based, movement is essential, enemies are unique and vary in type and abilities. âž£ Original soundtrack ranging from tense to serene ambient, spiced up with bursts of metal. Also, did I mention the legendary Alexander Brandon? If you enjoyed the Unreal and Deus Ex soundtracks, you''re in for a treat! âž£ Thousands of hours of work put into an original concept, digitally hand-drawn graphics (textures, sprites, frame by frame animations etc.), scripting, sound effects and level design, all by a one man dev team aiming to create a unique game with a unique atmosphere. âž£ Six to eight hours of good ''ol singleplayer action with five difficulties including Brutalizing, which changes the gameplay to allow interesting second playthroughs (different fights & pick-ups, companions etc.). âž£ It''s very light on storage (under 300mb) and well optimized. It''s also portable so no DRM and no online ties either - you buy it, it''s yours! My aim is to research classic game design and refresh the valuable bits we''ve lost in an experience that ultimately rewards the player through learning and investment rather than through mechanically administered gratification. Hedon is an oldschool game, and that''s pretty much enough of a description. You will be dropped in a hostile world that has its own workings, characters and intrigues, and you will be expected to fend for yourself. The build up is slow and steady, the story is consistent, the combat is fast paced and ruthless. You will sometimes find yourself lost in a non linear level design with various aesthetics (forest, caves, forge, barracks, snowy mountain etc.) where exploration and learning by yourself is the key to improve. You may find that Hedon takes a certain amount of atmosphere, gameplay, color and inspiration from games such as Unreal, Blood, Thief, Arx Fatalis, Serious Sam etc. but nonetheless aims to be original at all times. You play as Zan (any similarity with the creator''s username is a pure coincidence), a half Orc - half Demon warrior who wakes up in a caved in tunnel with no memory of how she ended up there. The first episode will focus on our hero''s descent into a strange underground world which is threatened by the sudden attack of a massive Cultist force. There are certain races and factions populating the world of Hedon. The Iron Division A faction of amazon-like Orcs and Goblins, the Iron Division are the keepers Hedon''s greatest secret - the crystal technology. Various magical crystals sprawl across the underground, providing energy, heat, oxygen and often forming entire biomes around them. Combining this power with crafting and the ancient art of magic, the Iron Division has founded a whole new civilization within their mountain stronghold known as Valc. The Cultists Fallen to sin, the raving husks of what were once human now worship various figures of the Underworld. Little can be done to cull their addiction to pain and suffering. Little but a spray of frag fire or an explosive bolt that is... The Demons Chaotic Demons dwell in the deepest parts of Hedon, lashing out at the weaker minds of the inhabitants of the Overworld. Along the ages, they have subdued entire towns to become their cultist slaves and feed their endless hunger through pain and suffering. Demons only care about feeding, and they will stop at nothing to do so. The Earthborn Ancient dwellers of the underground, Minotaurs and Dwarves have built their own civilizations, ever clenched in warfare with the Demons spawning from below. However, their great cities and heritage were lost hundreds of years after their inevitable defeat in front of Hell''s armies, and now they have been scattered and forced to live in small clans and towns. iamfailtacular - story collaboration/world building, brainstorming Akhzul - Hedon''s OST dedicated composer. A one guitar man band. Alexander Brandon - The man himself. If you enjoyed the soundtracks of Deus Ex or Unreal, then you''re in for a few pleasant surprises. I bought few licenses for some of his personal tracks (and other songs that didn''t make it in Deus Ex/Unreal) and fit them into Hedon! Breathelast - A band of underground sharks who pitched in with instrumental tracks of their songs. Also one of my favorite bands ever. Methadone Skies - Another solid band from the underground, guilty of creating dreamlike musical atmosphere. Shivaxi & Xenofish - 5 Michelin Star chef and his cool friend who made an awesome remix for Alexander Brandon''s Underworld.

Rulers will need all the strength of their subjects to sail away and find new kingdoms in these New Lands. Kingdom: New Lands builds upon the award-winning gameplay and mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy. Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you. Kingdom: New Lands asks you to puzzle things out on your own. You''ll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you but you''ll have to figure out just how exactly they''ll aide you in building and defending your Kingdom. Kingdom: New Lands is about exploration, discovery, survival and that awesome feeling that you get, when you figure something out, on your own. When multiple pieces all of a sudden come together to form a whole â€“ a basis for a new strategy or an understanding how something in the world of Kingdom: New Lands truly works. It is about tenacity and overcoming obstacles â€“ even when they seem to be unsurmountable. Pulling through, against all odds. Rebuilding and recovering. And that huge internal high-five when you succeed. It is about figuring out how best to manage your little Kingdom and tie everything together in a fashion where the game doesnâ€™t play you â€“ you play the game. Itâ€™s also beautiful, tranquil, melancholy, frantic, stressful and wonderful. It delivers a spectrum of emotions that combine into a unique experience. It''s a minimalist strategy game where you need to discover the rules of how the world behaves before you can rule effectively. It''s also a little bit whimsical, it''s pretty, and it can be frustrating but it won''t hold your hand.

Then, play and share the addresses via an on-line database.  Create your own maps using the built-in map editor and upload and share on-line.  Or, join with thousands of other players and peruse the databases of worlds created by others.  Want to create a new weapon, a unit, an enemy, or an effect?

In EmergeNYC''s new major Third Person Update a bunch of new things have been added. Choose one of many roles throughout each fire company and the main precinct in the city. Customize your character''s appearance & change to up to half a dozen different uniform options and over a dozen different firefighter and police officer models. Hop in and out of your vehicle whether you''re driving or just a passenger. Even split driving Tiller Ladder 75 in Multiplayer Third Person will seamlessly mix in with our current Multiplayer game play style, and you are able to spawn a character and customize them to your liking, all while it being extremely simple to leave your character, and switch back to driving other units on the map much easier. EmergeNYC is currently in Pre-Alpha State Tech Demo. This tech demo will allow players to drive all of the vehicles that we have currently completed and will be updated with more vehicles and features every week. You may also have up to 32 of your friends join you online with our new Multiplayer feature. The tech demo also gives players the chance to experiment with some core mechanics of the game and report bugs or feedback to be fixed and modified in daily patches. *Planned for full release* In EmergeNYC players will be thrown into a large dynamic and open-world which is based on a fictional New York City. Players will be able to take the role of a single member of a unit and possess the ability to switch to other units and personnel, command fellow AI firefighters and police officers, or join an online session and work with up to 32 players to protect the city and keep it running. EmergeNYC goes into depth when it comes to Emergency Simulation Games and aims to go where no other games in the genre have imagined. When starting EmergeNYC, you will be able to pick between Single Player Free Play and Co-Operative Multiplayer Free Play. In Single Player mode, you will have the ability to mesh how you want to play. If you prefer to have more control over things, you can play in Dispatcher/IC Mode, dispatching units to emergencies, and commanding units from above in an RTS and Emergency 4 inspired fashion. If you want to be more personal and interactive, Direct Control Mode is the way to go. When you switch to Direct Control, you will be able to take control of a single member of any unit whether it be an FDNY company, 2 NYPD Officers on a patrol, or EMS Partners awaiting a medical emergency. This mode functions as an advanced Third/First Person Simulation with a camera and character controller similar to Grand Theft Auto and other Open-World, Adventure, and Simulation games. EmergeNYC features realistic driving mechanics which accurately recreate the handling of different fire apparatus, police vehicles, and ambulances. Players will have the ability to switch between 3rd Person and 1st Person Cockpit cameras as well as have full control over their vehicles, including lights and sirens. In EmergeNYC, we have managed to create an advanced and stunning lighting system allowing the player to switch between different lighting patterns in a variety of different light bars and lighting setups. We have also given players full control of the siren(s) of their vehicle with the ability to wind up and down manual sirens seamlessly, honk the airhorns and switch between automatic siren modes. Traffic and pedestrians respond differently with how you use your sirens and horns. Third Person Gameplay update coming next week! In EmergeNYC''s new major Third Person Update a bunch of new things will be added. Choose one of many roles throughout each fire company and the main precinct in the city. Customize your character''s appearance & change to up to half a dozen different uniform options and over a dozen different firefighter and police officer models. Hop in and out of your vehicle whether you''re driving or just a passenger. Even split driving Tiller Ladder 75 in Multiplayer Third Person will seamlessly mix in with our current Multiplayer gameplay style, and you are able to spawn a character and customize them to your liking, all while it being extremely simple to leave your character, and switch back to driving other units on the map much easier.  FireFighters will be able to equip almost 2 dozen different types of equipment and tools which aid in whatever situation is facing them. Force doors open with a halligan, an axe, or a hydraulic rabbit tool, its your choice. Cut open a roll down door blocking access to a fire with a K12 Saw, get up to a window, scaffolding, roof top, or fire escape with different sized extension ladders. Knock down fires with different sized hoses, each one more difficult to maneuver through buildings and aim than the other. As a fireman you will also be able to rescue people, perform basic medical procedures to stabilize a victim, extricate people from vehicles, and more. Gameplay as a firefighter is primarily 3rd Person, however when applying your SCBA Air Pack and Face Mask before entering a burning building, you will be forcefully put into First Person Mode. This is done to try and simulate the visibility, sounds, and what it is like to be inside of a fire. Police Officers have much different but just as interactive and exciting gameplay. EmergeNYC aims to take the stereotypical police game out of the equation and focus more on what police officers in New York City face each day while also throwing the player into intense and risky situations. Lethal force is rarely necessary and this is a police game that tries to not glorify weapons, or constant shootings. In EmergeNYC, police officers will be negotiating with armed suspects, suicidal peeps, chasing down robbery suspects on foot, and if necessary as a last resort, using lethal force. However, gameplay as a police officer is not always like the movies. Players will still be performing traffic stops, writing tickets to double parked vehicles, directing traffic at emergency scenes, and performing crowd control. As an EMT/Paramedic in EmergeNYC, you will be experiencing the most in depth treatment and medical procedure system in any game. Players will be able to perform real life treatments, administer medications, perform life saving techniques and monitor a patient''s vital signs with the one goal of keeping them alive at an emergency scene and en-route to the hospital. From minor medical emergencies such as a diabetic suffering from hypoglycemia, to a catastrophic trauma like a civilian hit by a bus, or even pinned under a subway train. Gameplay will have the ability to be handicapped for players with no medical experience to have room for mistakes and learn basic medical procedures and treatments for different types of illnesses and injuries. In EmergeNYC, players will be able to join up to 32 friends on private or open user created servers with customization settings. Players will be able to work together, ride together and handle emergencies together. With an Arma inspired server lobby, once a player joins a server, any open position in a fire company, police patrol, or ambulance is able to be filled by a player. One player will have the ability to play as the dispatcher with an RTS view of the city and notify which units to respond to emergencies when they arise. With an established rank system, players who have filled sergeant, lieutet, captain, or chief positions will have a variety of commands available to give to AI or fellow players. EmergeNYC is based in a fictional open-world recreation of Manhattan with an advanced traffic and pedestrian system. When completed, this open world will contain dozens and dozens of buildings and areas to explore, ranging from stores, residential buildings, parking garages, high-rises with rooftops, subway stations and tunnels and interiors to house a wide variety of emergencies. It will also be beautifully detailed and features a dynamic weather/day & night system. EmergeNYC does not only go into detail and give players many options on the scene of an emergency, but also when not responding to a call and when en route to an emergency. Players will be able to interact with different environments when not occupied. Firefighters will be spread out across 5 unique firehouses with full interiors and 3 Engine Companies, 3 Ladder Companies,  A Squad Company, Rescue Company, and Battalion Chief ready to respond whenever and wherever needed. Police Officers will have a central fictional 14th precinct where players are able to choose and customize police vehicles, equipment, weapons, and their character. EMS workers will have a hospital emergency room to drop off patients, and resupply after a call.	;;	2004-03-12	;;	96.44	;;	516	;;	1

RWBY:GrimmEclipse	;;	RWBY: GRIMM ECLIPSE is a 4 player, online co-op, hack and slash game based upon Rooster Teethâ€™s international hit series RWBY.	;;	About This Software OVRdrop is a Utility Application for SteamVR that can mirror a Desktop Window, an entire Monitor, or a WebCam into a Cross Game SteamVR Overlay. OVRdrop works on SteamVR and should be fully compatible with any SteamVR headset, though you will need tracked controllers for many of the features. It is known to work for the HTC Vive as well as the Oculus Rift, though some games may not be compatible with the Rift . The only major downside is that Cross Game Overlays will always draw on top of game geometry because Depth information is not fed to the Compositor by SteamVR games. If you have any issues getting started, be sure to check the FAQ on our GitHub which I''ll try to keep updated with the most common questions. If you find any bugs, please post them to our issue tracker on our GitHub. I''m at the ready to fix any bugs that are found! Compatibility OVRdrop requires Windows 8/8.1 or 10. Windows 7 not supported due to technical limitations. Support for Windows 7 is planned for the future. Limited Oculus Rift/OSVR Support! OVRdrop should work perfectly with any SteamVR compatible headset when running through SteamVR . However some games will override the SteamVR SDK when using an Oculus Rift or an OSVR HMD, and prevent SteamVR from drawing to the headset. In this case, OVRdrop will not work with those games. Please check our Compatibility guide on our GitHub for more information. Please report Oculus Rift/OSVR success or failure on our GitHub Issue Tracker. Certain Oculus Rift games can be fixed and made to work with SteamVR/OVRdrop! Please see the announcement here for more details. OVRdrop will only work on the Oculus Rift in games that do not force the Oculus SDK! This is not something that can be fixed on our end. OVRdrop will only work on the OSVR HMD in games that do not force the OSVR SDK! This is not something that can be fixed on our end. HTC Vive is so far known to have 100% compatibility when running through SteamVR. However, some games could possibly break controller interaction. Please check our Compatibility guide on our GitHub for more information. Features Can clone almost any Desktop Window into VR. Can clone an entire monitor into VR. Can clone WebCam sources into VR. Side By Side 3D support for displaying Side By Side 3D content into VR. Works with almost any SteamVR Compatible game. Should work with any game that utilizes the SteamVR SDKs.

SaltandSanctuary	;;	Explore a haunting, punishing island in this stylized 2D action RPG. Salt and Sanctuary combines fast and brutal 2D combat with richly developed RPG mechanics in a cursed realm of forgotten cities, blood-soaked dungeons, and desecrated monuments.	;;	About This Game Renâ€™s virginity is in danger! His childhood friend Riria was frantically trying to take off his clothes and begging to touch him. The truth is that sheâ€™s actually a succubus and was embarrassed not having any sexual experience at her age. He was suddenly pushed into the schoolâ€™s special dormitory. It was a girlsâ€™ dormitory full of useless demons: Yuu, the yuki-onna who was extremely sensitive to the cold; Arle, the mummy girl who is uncomfortable with tightness and loves the feeling of freedom; Emiri, the hopeless angel who has no sense of modesty and who is also his step sister; and, Miyabi, the witch who passionately develops a love drug to bring happiness to the world. The dormitory was built to rehabilitate them and since he was mistakenly moved there, he was assigned as an assistant to watch over them. His happy and troublesome days as a teacher for these cute but incompetent demons has begun. Characters Kiritani Riria (VA: Ogura Yui) Real name: Lilia Nunnally Eisenstadt A puppy-like childhood friend with a calming aura. Her parents and Ren''s have been friends long before, and she has always been with Ren ever since she can remember. Riria is bad at thinking about complex things, preferring to brush things off with a smile. Surprisingly stubborn once she digs her heels in, and has a tendency to rush into things. Especially in anything related to lewd matters. Riria is concerned about her childish side, and is also easily embarrassed. Even though she is a succubus, she isn''t unreserved; only possessing an insatiable sexual desire for her beloved, but clinging tightly onto her chastity. ''Have a succubus as your bride and you''ll be blessed with a peaceful family, a happy partner, and wonderful children'' is what they say, but her motto is ''My rival is their right hand.\" A succubus''s saliva is as viscous as Pepe-rice (rice mixed with pepperoncini) -- time to dig in~ ''I don''t want you saying other girls are lewder! I''m the lewdest! Geez!\" Childish Succubus Race: Succubus Height: 156 cm Three sizes: B92 / W56 / H89 Blood type: O Birthday: April 10 Likes: Sweet and sticky girls'' romance manga, lazing around, lewd stuff Fujima Emiri (VA: Tachibana Mao) Real name: Emilia Ultimecia Ren''s stepsister with an upbeat personality, and a fallen angel who clings onto her brother. Currently in her first year of school. The two are close enough that they can joke around with each other, but doesn''t forget her special sister''s privilege of being doted on. A long time ago, Emiri used to be a cupid-inspired idol, but decided to retire when urged to become a variety show idol. Having grown sick of the pure and simple life of an angel, she ran away from home. There she met Ren and grew fond of him, and decided to become his little sister. With Ren''s parents constantly away on long trips, she and him are practically alone. Whenever Ren grows silent, she suddenly barges into his room, or sometimes digs around the tissues in his garbage -- Emiri is quite the busybody. Also, she can apparently inherit the name of Cupid thanks to her family standing, but absolutely refuses because she would ''never want some lame name that sounds like mayonnaise\". However, her arrows of love as a fallen angel are aimed straight at her brother. ''Even if we''re living under the same roof, I''ve never had a lucky perv moment catching Ren when he''s whacking it.\" Brother-loving Stepsister Fallen Angel Race: Angel Height: 152 cm Three sizes: B86 / W53 / H83 Blood type: B Birthday: December 12 Likes: Skinship with brother, teasing her brother like a sadist Ayasaki Yuu (VA: Ayumi Sarah) Real name: Mashiro Aoyuki A yuki-onna who is extremely sensitive to the cold, currently in second year. Though she doesn''t say much, she likes to talk. Though her expressions aren''t very pronounced, she has a wide range of emotions... A girl''s heart is complex. Yuu has a strong metabolism and sweats profusely if it gets just a little hot, or eats something even mildly spicy. Even if her face is bright red, she brushes it off as ''nothing\", but her obstinacy quickly gives way and she gives up honestly. Yuu gets the chills quite easily from lower temperatures and likes to cling onto Ren, but whenever she starts sweating, she gets a little moist and sticky, and her smell and sensations get rather arousing. Also, even though she looks pretty frigid, she''s actually heavily into pleasuring herself. Despite having lived in an isolated yuki-onna village, she can use computers and other modern devices perfectly. Sweaty and voluptuous... she''s also a real perv in that sense. ''It''s still so cold even in July. Share some of your warmth with me. *hug*\" A Yuki-onna Sensitive to the Cold and Longs for Contact Race: Yuki-onna Height: 162 cm Three sizes: B96 / W59 / H92 Blood type: O Birthday: January 20 Likes: Super spicy food, lukewarm baths (likes to take long soaks with bath additives) Arisegawa Arle (CV: Ueda Akane) Real name: Arle Titi Melnar Anebhij (etc.) A very polite, very serious, very methodical, very rational mummy girl; first year. She doesn''t like tight clothes on her body however, and apparently doesn''t wear clothes at all. Even without clothes, her skin is incredibly sensitive, and she cannot walk comfortably because she''s conscious about the clothes she''s wearing. Although it''s embarrassing for her because she finds it physically disagreeable, she has no choice but to tough it own whenever she goes outside. On a side note, having bandages wrapped around themselves is the formal dress for a mummy; in these modern times, only traditional families still wear them. At school and in the dormitory, she takes care of pets as the sole member of the biology club. She feels at ease because animals don''t care about being naked or not. Arle also can''t sleep right with a different bed or pillow, so she brought over her personal coffin from her home. The coffin is fully equiped with both power and air conditioning: perfect for the ultimate lazing around. ''Animals don''t have to wear clothes, so why can''t we all stay naked...?

Refreshing and candid, she is sports-minded and would rather charge into things head-on rather than think about them. Miyabi takes good care of people regardless of who they are so she''s quite popular. Rather famous, in fact, as she also does modeling work for magazines on the side. Her abilities in sports are so great that she''s often asked to help out in the sports clubs, but her academics are catastrophic. The way she formulates medicine is rough and imprecise, so her parents are also against her becoming a pharmacist. That her studies are so terrible that it''s practically impossible for her to get national certification provides some relief for her parents. Concerned about the declining birth rate and issues of infertility, she believes that if she can develop a drug to boost energy and vigor, then the world can be a happier place. She tries to create her own original drug for that through learning by imitation, but fails and becomes a victim of her own aphrodisiac medicines. As a result, she has a lot of experience in self-pleasure. By the way, she prefers inserting her fingers inside. ''Haven''t you thought of how many people could be happy if there was a super drug that can supercharge your vitality?\" Energy Potion Researching Clueless Witch Height: 166 cm Three sizes: B84 / W58 / H88 Blood type: O Birthday: February 11 Likes: Formulating original medicines, enjoying a relaxing teatime by herself Shibasaki Rin (VA: Fujisaki Usa) Real name: Lyr A serious and straightforward kind of underclassman of the Tigerkin race, in first year. An athletic and super mega positive girl. To the point where she should maybe take a step back once in a while. Lovable idiot. On full moons, she''s supposed to turn into a were cat, but only her tail and ears can change. She goes to the school to conquer this. Brimming with curiosity, she normally dashes around and about, causing a ruckus. She, Emiri, and Arle are classmates and good friends, and are often together. Rin works part time at a convenience store so she doesn''t cause her family trouble; she loves the bentos that are about to be thrown out from expiry. There are tears when she has near-expiration bento for lunch, but if it''s barbeque bento then the happiness continues ''til the next day. When a tiger enters its mating season, it''s said to mate over a hundred times in a period of two days. It seems that she isn''t an exception.

Though she looks perfectly nice and cute, her insides are a swirling mass of cynicism and neuroses. She has an uncanny ability to pick up when someone makes fun of her, and her temper is exceedingly short. But her anger is also quick to abate, so everyone pretty much loves her. Though she comes from a distinguished family, she''s quite the bungler and her parents call her a rotten fruit. Her grandfather spoiled her when she grew up, however, so she ended up like this. Aifa of course doesn''t do her job at all, but she doesn''t do the chores either, instead immersing herself completely in games and anime. Still, her body is maturing as it should for her age, with her youthful parts down there loosening up somewhat. Even for someone of a demonic race, her woman''s body sure is full of mysteries.

She''s also the bridge between this world and that, taking care of the exchange students. Though curt and a straight shooter who doesn''t mince words, she isn''t by any means unfair. In fact, many people look up to her for as someone to rely on. Her daughter''s feebleness rather annoys her, and she does want Riria to become a great succubus. Also, her sexual frustration is building up because her husband hasn''t come back home in a long time. Because succubi are incredibly devoted in their service, she finds herself very troubled as she can do nothing but wait impatiently.

Player discretion is advised. IMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and builds tension slowly to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. Youâ€™ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn''t even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. Youâ€™ll soon wish you could join the dead''s ranks in their abyss, but death won''t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. Theyâ€™ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. Youâ€™ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you''ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane. 	;;	2010-07-05	;;	3.91	;;	44	;;	4

The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments. Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator. The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew. All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual. 	;;	2007-02-06	;;	168.85	;;	143	;;	5

In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous titleâ€™s hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ''other'' La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana. Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ''Guardians'' as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins. You wonâ€™t believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey... La-Mulana was known as a ''Metroidvania\"-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins. A classic experience : As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it''s up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own. Explore at your own pace : By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings. A colossal adventure : We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability. New horrors, new weapons : Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey. Widescreen support : The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors. The question weâ€™ve asked ourselves throughout development is: ''How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?\" Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruins Gather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruins Dive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progress A detailed and beautifully dot-rendered world Seven main weapons and over ten sub-weapons Over 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruins Over 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurerâ€™s tablet, the ''Mobile Super X3'' Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the game Lumisa Kosugi (21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game''s protagonist) Some say she is Lemeza''s wife''s daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she''s Professor Shawn''s illegitimate child. Either way, she is a Kosugi; that much is clear. She travels to La-Mulana to make her archaeological debut after accepting Xelpud''s request to search the ruins. Lemeza Kosugi (36 years old; the previous game''s protagonist) Tales of his exploits in the ruins of La-Mulana may be known worldwide, but he was also responsible for the ruins'' destruction, and has gone into hiding as a result. His love of exploration has not faded, however, and he still finds time to go spelunking in secret. Shawn Kosugi (67 years old) After revealing the ''Treasure of All Life'' he brought back from the ruins of La-Mulana, he returned to a hermetic life once more. Although he technically retired after finishing his research on the ''Cradle of All Civilization\", he finds himself slowly drawn back into the world of archaeology. Elder Xelpud (Age unknown) Upon the collapse of the La-Mulana ruins, his life as a 7th Child came to an end. He''s been spending his time running the ''La-Mulana Ruins Tourist Spot'' in hopes of finding purpose in life once again. As a result, he''s become quite wealthy, and now lives a life of luxury full of beautiful women and fast cars. Mulbruk (3024 years old; looks/hopes to look about 24) Since her release from the ruins, Mulbruk has been happily living aboveground, pretending to be a ''normal'' young woman. Using her amazing knowledge of history, she has become a treasure hunter. She''s also become quite fashionable. 	;;	2005-01-02	;;	13.54	;;	435	;;	5

STORY Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wangâ€™s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zillaâ€™s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world.

Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. Brutal Damage System: Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system.

In this peaceful world, there lived a Treasure Hunter, the protagonist, Claire. Hearing a rumor of a treasure that could grant any wish, Claire traveled to the fabled land of Alstroemeria. Word of the treasure being in Alstroemeria had caused it to explode with activity. And Claire was not alone, as many other adventurers also came in search of the treasure.

Measure your devotion and your bravery by journeying into deepest darkness for answers to questions that will challenge your very existence. Dark Devotion features a richly detailed, immersive narrative that unfolds a sombre tale of your Templar religionâ€™s irresistible calling. Every encounter challenges your fortitude, piety, and conviction as you move deeper into your cursed pilgrimage. Spanning four unique worlds, each with their own incredibly detailed environments, youâ€™ll wield dozens of weapons in your quest to discover the Templeâ€™s secret: all the while assailed by dark enemies and devious bosses whose core mission is to destroy your soul and damn you forever. Throughout Dark Devotion youâ€™ll discover an array of weapons, armors, and relics with which to enhance your character. Each item has its own attributes and statistics, and is customizable with mystical runes. It is essential that you maximize your strengths and adapt your inventory to the enemy youâ€™re facing. Choose wisely... Dark Devotion is a story of perseverance, dedication, and secrets. Every chest you open, every item you encounter holds another piece of the story: be it a letter, weapon, or clue, all will help you on your quest. Whether you find these secrets amongst the shadows or in the dead hand of another character ...well, that all depends. In the Temple, Faith is your only recourse against the heathen droves. Defeat them to collect Faith and unlock secret paths, special chests, and more. But remember to use your Faith sparingly. Nothing lasts forever. The Temple yearns to see you dead. Your survival depends on using the right item at the right time to heal your wounds or dispel a curse. Some of these items can be looted, others are scattered throughout the Temple in secret places. Employ them wiselyâ€¦ your life depends on it. The eye of your God is ever-watchful. Complete an act of bravery or skill, and your God might bless you. But the Temple is also rife with despair and sickness, ready to destroy those who lack courage and temperance. Learn quickly its ways, or suffer. Salvation is fleeting, so choose your route wisely. Every world in Dark Devotion offers several different paths. Each one is original, but all are interconnected, and the only commonality they share is that there is no turning back. Completing your quest requires shrewd interpretation of the secrets shrouded within the Temple. Itâ€™s easy to get lost, though this might bring you favor...depending on the secret you uncover. Perhaps the Temple will reveal a hidden altar where oneâ€™s story can be saved if one honors the Temple appropriately...or perhaps not. â— Dynamic and heavy combat â— Dozens of weapons, armor, and items for various fighting styles â— Intricate system of blessings, curses, and illnesses â— White-knuckle boss battles â— Rich, complex storyline â— Dark levels and brooding environments	;;	2005-01-26	;;	55.42	;;	672	;;	5

While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive. In order to survive and overcome all challenges, you need to attract followers, bringing them into your refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without followers, you can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting only makeshift tools and weapons.  Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well you read weather patterns, and if you come to the right conclusion: either to look for shelter or to press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming. Features: Tense atmosphere and unforgiving gameplay. This is a strategistâ€™s game. An exploration mode lets you roam the world and experience the story at your own pace. Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8kmÂ² area. Wolf Sled Expeditions: Pack your sled, take a follower with you and engage in long-term expeditions into the farthest regions. Recruit followers to get access to better gear, enabling you to survive the cold environment and increasingly dangerous creatures. Lead your followers and keep them alive. You will face harsh moral choices. Battle increasingly dangerous Eldritch creatures that roam an apocalyptic world. 2 player co-op gameplay (once the host player has recruited the first follower) Trust your inner voice. It is your friend. 	;;	2007-03-16	;;	157.24	;;	203	;;	4

Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? Who are you? Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a pure-strain descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domesâ€”the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the Holy City; the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul; or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon. You arrive at the oasis-hamlet of Joppa, along the far rim of Moghra''yi, the Great Salt Desert. All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk. On the horizon, Qud''s jungles strangle chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth. Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky. You clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat. You approach a watervine farmerâ€”he lifts the brim of his straw hat and says, ''Live and drink, friend.\" What can you do? Anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world. Assemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects and 24 castes and kitsâ€”outfit yourself with wings, two heads, quills, four arms, flaming hands, or the power to clone yourselfâ€”it''s all the character diversity you could want. Explore procedurally-generated regions with some familiar locationsâ€”each world is nearly 1 million maps large. Dig through everythingâ€”don''t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point. Hack the limbs off monstersâ€”every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things. Pursue allegiances with over 60 factionsâ€”apes, crabs, robots, and highly entropic beingsâ€”just to name a few. Follow the plot to Barathrum the Old, a sentient cave bear who leads a sect of tinkers intent on restoring technological splendor to Qud. Learn the loreâ€”there''s a story in every nook, from legendary items with storied pasts to in-game history books written by plant historians. Dieâ€”Caves of Qud is brutally difficult and deaths are permanent. Don''t worry, thoughâ€”you can always roll a new character. 	;;	2018-08-20	;;	119.62	;;	202	;;	4

Your ship rapidly evolves as you defeat enemies, allowing you to shape its abilities and weaponry to your desires in a matter of minutes. Unlike many ARPGs which can absorb hundreds of hours of time, Nova Drift allows you to take a ship build from inception to execution in a single game session. Features Create a unique build every run. Games are quick, allowing for rapid experimentation, iteration, and advancement. Cunning and creativity are rewarded as you chain upgrade modules for powerful synergies, reminiscent of deck-building games. Access over 120 modular upgrades as you progress and expand your arsenal.  Build to play how you want . Snipe, command a drone army, discharge your shields, charge up, burn enemies with your thrusters, or smash right through them... there''s a way to make it work. Unlock various challenge modes , providing greater risk and rewards. The stakes are high, as death is permanent! Every game is randomly generated , keeping the fight intense and unpredictable. Fight through the campaign or play endlessly ... Nova Drift is a living game. Frequent updates will continue to expand the depth and content of the game world. Upcoming Updates: Weapon: Thermal Lance |  Shield: Shockwave ]  |  Super Mod: Barrage  Weapon Mutations : 1-2 variations for each existing weapon New Challenge Mode: Wild Metamorphosis - extremely rare mods that have a variety of powerful and/or bizarre effects Translation into French, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese & more... FULL ROADMAP Ship Evolutions Mods & Gear can be unlocked, upgraded and combined to make unexpected and powerful combinations: Example Build #1: Seeking Cluster Grenade Grenade + Body: Assault + High Explosive + Splinter Shot + Heat Seeking + Charged Shot This build focuses on creating as many grenade splinters as possible using the Grenade weapon and sends them tearing toward targets using the Heat Seeking mod. The overlapping blasts from the initial explosion add up to a huge amount of damage at the epicenter, while the seeking clusters handle crowd control. Example Build #2: Celestial Shield-Bomber Hullbreaker + Amp Shield + Volatile Shields + Flash Shielding + Emergency Systems + Celestial Lance This build takes advantage of the Hullbreaker''s speed and resilience to crash damage to slam directly into enemies. The fragile Amp Shield is used not for defense, but to augment Hullbreaker''s strongest aspects, gaining increased speed and force. The shield will break on impact, but we can capitalize on that using the Volatile Shields mod, which detonates the shield when it goes down, blasting all nearby enemies. Flash Shielding gets it running again quickly while Emergency Systems grant a moment of damage immunity, making charge attacks safer. Finally, Celestial Lance is used to deal burning damage to everything around the ship at high velocities! Nova Drift is developed by Jeffrey Nielson of Chimeric , a 1-man development team, featuring music and audio by Miles Tilmann of Pixeljam .	;;	2004-10-11	;;	28.44	;;	467	;;	3

StrongholdCrusader2	;;	Stronghold Crusader 2 is the long awaited sequel to the original castle sim. After 12 years Stronghold returns to the desert with a new 3D engine and powerful Havok Physics. Crusader 2 recaptures the original gameâ€™s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation.	;;	About This Game Beasts of Bermuda is a multiplayer game hosting large servers in which the player is a dinosaur or other prehistoric creature. A player can take the role of flyers, swimmers, herbivores, carnivores, and semi-aquatic creatures that fulfill different niches in the ecosystem. No matter what the player chooses to be, the objective of the game is to survive and grow up on the islands of Bermuda by using their particular creature''s abilities. Predation from other players as well as intense environmental events are the antagonistic forces in the game the player must survive against.  There are currently three game modes in Beasts of Bermuda.  The first is our Life Cycle mode of gameplay.  The player selects a creature of choice and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species.  They must survive and gradually grow larger over time.  As growth accumulates, they also earn talents, which can be spent to enhance different aspects of your creature''s capabilities.  The second is Free Roam, which allows the player to instantly spawn as an adult with a fixed number of talent points.  Death has little consequence, as there are no growth mechanics, or other mechanics that reward the player for staying alive.  The third game mode is Combat.  This mode pits players against one another with small maps, close spawns, and mechanics designed to reward conflict.  The player can accrue more talent points by killing other players and stealing their points.	;;	2019-12-05	;;	52.81	;;	405	;;	2
SupremeCommander2	;;	Includes 47 Steam achievements, leaderboards, and stats!	;;	About This Game  Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and theyâ€™re gone forever; lose everything, and itâ€™s game over!  You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning â€” your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.  Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion. A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors. Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your fatherâ€™s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake â€“ this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival.  Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.  Itâ€™s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. Itâ€™s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.  Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North .	;;	2015-03-02	;;	68.84	;;	252	;;	2

This remaster of the mythical â€˜castle simâ€™ features Steam multiplayer, Workshop support, new maps, achievements and DLC campaigns.	;;	About This Game  A multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building. Get born to another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch. Hey folks, I''m Jason Rohrer, and I''ve been working on One Hour One Life for more than three years.  I''ve been doing everything myself---I drew all the graphics on paper with pens and markers, I coded the entire engine from scratch, I composed and performed all of the music, and I even made all of the sound effects.  It''s a very personal game, and it''s really unlike anything else that''s out there.  It''s also a huge game---over 1300 fully interactive, craftable objects already.  And it''s only getting bigger, with weekly updates adding new things all the time.  The game was initially released on my own website in February of 2018, and over the intervening months, I released 29 updates off-Steam.  I''ve promised to keep releasing weekly update for at least the next two years, with the end goal of making the largest, most comprehensive crafting game in history. Okay, so what about the game itself? First of all, you only live for an hour, where each minute marks a passing year.  You join the game server as a newborn baby, and some other randomly-chosen player is your mother.  You depend on her for your survival.  And why will she be willing to waste her valuable time and resources to keep you alive?  Because she''s going to die in an hour just like everyone else, and if she wants what she accomplishes in her lifetime to have any meaning, then the next generation (aka, you) is her only hope.  And if you survive into adulthood, you may get the chance to have babies of your own---other players, just joining the server---and those babies will be the next generation that gives meaning to your own life accomplishments. Across this ever-growing family tree of generations, players are collectively conducting an enormous project:  they are rebuilding civilization from scratch.  The online game world starts out as a near-infinite expanse of wilderness (four billion meters wide from east to west, and four billion meters wide from north to south, with a total surface area of over 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 square meters, or 36,000 times bigger than Earth).  The very first player to join the server is Eve, and she starts out in the wilderness as the root of the family tree.  Eve and her immediate offspring lay the foundation for the future civilization, perhaps making a few primitive tools, cooking basic foods, and starting a small farm as they scrape out a meager existence before dying.  Future generations will build on this primitive foundation, eventually mastering more and more advanced technology, including domesticated animals, metal working, permanent buildings, and transportation networks. But as real-life history has shown, civilization is fragile.  A generation that is born into the lap of luxury---on the backs of their ancestors'' hard-won accomplishments---can just as easily squander their inheritance as build upon it.  Key resources run out over time, so careful management, planning, and organization are necessary to prevent an inevitable collapse.  Thus, the game graduates from the individual challenge of primitive survival in the early stages to a group organizational and leadership challenge in the later stages.  How do rules and procedures for group survival propagate across multiple generations?  What did our great grandparents have in mind for this village? The main mode in the game involves being born as a helpless baby to another player as your mother, but you can also play with your friends as twins, triplets, or quadruplets.  One baby is hard enough to take care of---any mother that can successfully take care of quadruplets deserves the eternal gratitude of you and your friends. All of this is happening on my own centrally-managed, persistent servers, and your purchase includes a lifetime account on these official servers.  After you buy the game, you can instantly connect to this world with no configuration or server set-up.  It all just works.  You also get access to the full source code, including the server code.  Technically-minded folks can run their own private servers, or even use the powerful content editor to make their own mods. I hope you''ll join us as this sprawling civilization-building experiment continues to unfold.  Many thousands of players have already collectively lived over 400,000 hours in this endlessly-changing world so far.  Before the Steam release, the average playtime for each player was 17 hours, with dozens of players logging over 500 hours each, and 94% positive off-Steam player reviews.  This is a deep and rich game already, and there are still hundreds of content updates to come. No two lives are ever the same, and a new story always awaits on the other side of the [GET REBORN] button. Jason Rohrer October 2018 Davis, California	;;	1999-10-03	;;	44.69	;;	309	;;	4

Set in a unique fantasy world, Druidstone is filled with ancient lush forests, standing stones, snow-topped mountains, deadly creatures and puzzle-ridden ruins. And somewhere in the middle of all of this, caught in the flow of events, are Aava, the archdruid''s daughter, who must now shoulder his responsibilities, Leonhard, a warden with a mysterious past and a lethal destiny, and Oiko, the failed Red Priest who is living proof that one may be very smart without being particularly wise. Along the way, they meet companions and villains, whose unique personalities and abilities make every encounter memorable.

The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises arenâ€™t made in the very near future. Rean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial Nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply embedded into the hearts of every Erebonian since the days of old. As a seventeen-year-old student preparing for his new life at Thors Military Academy, however, he notices that his crimson uniform differs from the standard ones issued to his peersâ€”typically green for commoners, and white for nobles. Enter, Class VII of Thors Military Academy. For the first time in the prestigious academyâ€™s history, rank means nothing and skill means everything. With nine hand-picked students of various backgrounds and abilities, Rean included, Class VII readies itself to dive deep into the political quagmire that threatens not only them, but the Empire as a whole. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcomâ€™s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel ( Sen no Kiseki in Japanese) is the first in the series to tread Erebonian soil and explore the inner political conflicts of this oft-mentioned powerhouse nation in detail. Delve into the expansive lore that has become synonymous with the series, enjoy school life and bond with fellow students to earn new abilities in battle, take advantage of speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed â€œARCUSâ€ system, and uncover dramatic events that stand to change everything these two opposing social classes stand for.

Everything is already dead or dying... except you. Or so you think.

Players will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end of the world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each chapter of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result, you''ll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But you don''t have forever. Certain actions advance the in-game clock, and you''ll need to complete your preparations to (hopefully) stay alive before night falls. Will you make it through all four days? Will your companions? Features: A classic pixelart aesthetic and creepy atmosphere from a veteran of horror and thrillers. Logical puzzles and exploration to challenge players without frustrating them. Time mechanics; certain actions advance the clock in a race against time. A post-apocalyptic thriller, with an engaging storyline and cast. Moody and engrossing original musicial score. Multiple variations for each chapter mean multiple playthroughs with new content. About the Developer: Poland-based developer Scriptwelder is a well known creator of creepy web-based games, perhaps the most iconic of which is the Deep Sleep series, which has won multiple awards and been played by millions all around the world. The Don''t Escape series began as a web game that inverted the classic escape-the-room formula... rather than trying to find a way out, players were instead trying to find a way to secure themselves within, usually from some sort of threat or danger. Don''t Escape: 4 Days to Survive is his first full length premium game.	;;	2016-01-02	;;	54.21	;;	547	;;	1
